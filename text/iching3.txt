Yijing Hexagram Names and Core Meanings
易經卦名和中義
Yìjīng guàmíng hé zhōngyì

© Bradford Hatcher, 2011, Version 12.1

Preface

    Since this is primarily a reference work, the introductory material has been placed at the end, to facilitate scrolling through the 64 tables below.
    These tables offer what a large number of different translators and authors have used for Hexagram Names (Gua Ming) and/or major Core Meanings (Zhong Yi) for the 64 Gua. (The eight Bagua and other symbols are already covered in my Book of Changes, Vol. 1, Xiao Xiang chapter). Multiple listings in these tables should absolutely not be regarded as a poll or a vote. The Wilhelm-Baynes Gua Ming, while at least adequate more often than not, has exerted a huge and, in many cases, undue influence on other authors. A number of authors have been omitted because they simply copied Wilhelm's names. Other writers seem to have groped about for synonyms to Wilhelm's names and substituted these with little or no insight into the Core Meanings. Of particular importance is the last entry in the tables, which comes from the Shi Yi, the Ten Wings or Appendices of the Yijing itself, added to the Zhouyi  during the Han Dynasty. Although written six or more centuries after the Zhouyi, many of these glosses have had a dominant or even absolute influence over how the Gua Ming have come to be understood. The bulk of these come from the Tuan Zhuan, or Commentary on the Judgment. In many cases, these are the only significant or meaningful contribution that the Tuan Zhuan makes. In some places I have instead given glosses from other Wings: the Da Xiang, the Xu Gua or the Za Gua.
    The Key Words section is from my Book of Changes, Vol. 1. These represent a partial scoping of Core Meanings. The Glossary section is from my Book of Changes, Vol. 2. These list the possible translations of the Chinese names, but without strict regard to meanings attested for the Early Zhou. Finally, in the Notes section, I try to make relevant comments on some of the Names used in the tables and point out problems with some of the conventional names.

Notes:
    On Heaven: I have argued elsewhere that one of the great mistakes of the social sciences in studying the past is in making sweeping generalizations about cultural norms which are more usefully considered as broad spectra. It shouldn't need saying that the Christian and Muslim notions of Heaven have no place here. While Heaven is indeed sacred in most Chinese traditions, it is not a deity. On the average, it is the grand order of things, the natural law, the clockworks, the self-organizing power that drives the heavens. This warrants great respect, even reverence, at least as an alternative to self-destruction. There is still a broad range in this comprehension on the secular-religious axis and even the range from king to king could well have been quite dramatic, even though the king was at the very head of the popular religion. The transition from Shang to Zhou represented a movement towards the secular side, but a great many, no doubt, maintained a belief that the spirit resided in Heaven after death, and many of those, under the care of Shang Di, the Highest Divinity. The Zhouyi tends towards the secular. Even though there are plenty of snapshots of both the king and the people doing religious practices and sacrifices, the study is always of the human behavior and its attitudes in performing these acts. It never once proposes or supports a religious or metaphysical idea.  To be sure, a lot of metaphysics was added to the Yi in the Han Dynasty, with the canonization of the Yijing's Ten Wings, but this is not our concern here. Heaven, then, is best understood here as the motive power of the cosmos, highly structured but not likely sentient. Maybe the bottom line is this: if you can discover what Heaven "will" do, and take this to be Heaven's Will, and somehow align your objectives in this direction, then you will have the assistance of Heaven, along with an infinite reserve of inertia and power.

Notes:
On Yin: The Zhouyi was written long before there was a metaphysics of Yin and Yang. The authors did have a strong concept of the interplay of opposites, but this was still more of a description of the Way the world behaved than a cosmology of two ultimate and universal forces. The contrast of Qian and Kun, Gua 01 and 02, along with other pairs, notably 11-12, 41-42 and 63-64 could perhaps be regarded as early prototypes of the Taijitu and the Yin-Yang idea, but they simply did not have the more complex reasoning that came with the Yinyang Jia or School of Yin-Yang philosophy. For purposes here, then, Heaven-Earth, Creating-Creation or even Energy-Mass are less anachronistic names than Yang-Yin.

Notes:
The link between Sprout and Difficult Beginnings is the image of the freshly sprouted plant emerging from the Earth into a storm, with no alternative but to call upon or rally all of its resources. The ability to secure whatever resources and help it requires will be its answer to evolution's selection process.

Notes:
The continuum here is is from Ignoring, willfully or stubbornly failing to consider new experience, to the more innocent kind of Ignorance, not yet having had the opportunity to learn. Ignorance, then, when purely pejorative and not used in fun, is not the best Gua Ming.

05.M, Key Words
Waiting, awaiting, readying, earliness, suspense, calculated inaction, patience
 Gratification deferred involuntarily, satisfaction postponed, delays, deprivation 
Presence of mind, window of opportunity, being properly ready, providing for 
Nourishment, necessities, essentials, prospects, hunger and thirst, prerequisites 
Doing without, biding time, working on worthiness, maximizing the meanwhile
 Making the most of emptiness & want; getting ready, invocation; looking out for 

05.G, From the Glossary
Xu1 (to be) essential, needful, necessary, insufficient, tantalized, suspended; (a, the) anticipation, suspense, expectation, desire, demand, need, duty, obligation, necessity, requirement, prerequisite; (to) wait, await, abide, bide time, postpone,  arry, stop, defer, do without, watch for, look out for, need, require (s, ed, ing);  Suowen has stopped by rain, waiting it out instead of waiting for rain; [deferred  grtification]

Notes:
Xu is a Janus word, a word with two seemingly or partially opposite meanings. The only one that seems to be in use here means to wait, for rain or nourishment, with the advice being to make proper use of the time in getting ready for or worthy of fulfillment, to optimize or maximize the meanwhile. The other meaning, to be soaked by rain, does not seem to have any relevance in the Zhouyi context. The other Xu, given in the Ten Wings, is also polysemous in the Yi, with meanings elsewhere in the text of Beard and Older Sister.

06.M, Key Words
Advocacy, adversarialism, partiality, partisanship, taking or promoting one side 
Presumption, challenge, competition; ambivalence, approach-approach conflicts 
Conflict, disparity, dissent, dissonance, points of view within the bigger picture 
Resistance, friction, strife, grievance, litigation, dispute, contest, confrontation 
Arbitration, diplomacy, (re)conciliation, reconsideration, mid-course corrections 
Revisiting postulates & reference frames, using feedback, finding metasolutions

06.G, From the Glossary
Song4 (a, the) contention, conflict, challenge, dispute, dissent, litigation, argu- ment, quarrel, contest, antagonism; (to) contend, dispute, challenge, contest, dis sent, litigate, accuse, argue, quarrel, reprimand, advocate, speak out publicly,  bring (suit, a complaint, a grievance), demand justice, plead before a court (s, ed, ing); (to be) quarrelsome, adversarial

Notes:
The biggest problem with the word Conflict for a Gua Ming is in its seeming implication of necessary ill-will. It doesn't cover the other conditions possible here: of jousting, sport, sporting competition, lively debate, the free marketplace of ideas, or healthy dialectic. These all need to be recognized as having potential positive value. The word Contention is one of the options broad enough to encompass this wideer range, or at least that is my contention.

07.M, Key Words
Ready reserves, liquidity, solvency, mobile and fungible assets, resourcefulness
 Interdependence, collective force, strength in numbers, coalition, solidarity, allies 
Instruction, discipline, training, regimen; planning for contingency, preparedness 
Hedging, strategic security, expedience; chain of command based on merit or skill
 Guardians, host; multiple uses of resources, the masses used as reservoir or pool 
A defensive army disguised as a people, an ad hoc army or a grass-roots militia 

07.G, From the Glossary
Shi1 (a, the) militia, military, reserves, army, armies, host, hosts, legion(s), troops, garrison; general, master, specialist, teacher, tutor, expert, leader, instructor, director, sage, assessor, example, (role) model; expertise, organization, preparedness, readiness;  liquidity]; all; the people, the multitude, population; (to) teach, instruct, emulate,  iitate, take as a norm or standard; model or pattern after another; militarily; unit  of2500 troops

Note:
It is a little misleading to gloss this as The Army, especially with its modern connotation of “standing army.” However, the late 20th century army (militia) of Switzerland provides a nearly perfect example of the hidden, liquid and mobile Reserves described and advocated in this Gua. Their knives also have the corkscrews and fingernail files, for performing their alternate duties as regular people and citizens. The notions of Leader, Teacher, or the role of experience, also figure importantly in 07's core meaning, providing the instruction or instilled/ingrained structures that allow the masses to change their shape when the need arises.

08.G, From the Glossary
Bi3 (to) accord, belong, combine, go together, join, affiliate, unite, associate (to, with); sort, compare, match, assemble, join, follow, (put, hold) together, draw an analogy (s, ed, ing); (to be) affiliated, paired (with), concordant, well-disposed;  lose, familiar; successive, comparable, analogous, similar; on behalf of; (a, the)  uion, belonging, affiliation, association, togetherness, congestion, commonality

Notes:
Joining together for a purpose or a cause, as for an alliance, security or support, is much more consistent with the core meaning of Gua 45 that 08. Both are formed of Water over the Earth, but more artifice is required, in the form of dams or embankments, to contain the body of water than the stream. The Togetherness in Gua 08 is out of a natural affinity and common ground. The water here is free-flowing. It is more about belonging than joining.

Micromanagement, diminishing returns, getting caught up in the details, fussiness
 Irritants, nuisances, trifles, worries, cares, distractions, the back-breaking straws 
Attrition, erosion, small demands; wearing forces, shaping, refining & polishing 
Long-term finitude, insignificance, limited influence, tiny pieces of big puzzles

09.G, From the Glossary
Xiao3  (to be) average, common, diminished, homogeneous, humble, insignificant, lesser, light, little, low(ly, er, est), mean, mediocre, minor, minute, modest, ordi- nary, slight, small(er, est), petty, tiny, trifling, trivial, unimportant, young(er, est), minimal; (a, the) commonness, homogeneity, littleness, meanness, mediocrity,  ettiness, smallness; commonly, ordinarily; in detail; some small, of little, a little;  fr a short (time, while); (to) diminish, minimize, shrink, belittle; does not imply  ba or wrong, but sometimes inferiority.

Notes:
The expression “God is in the detail” is attributed to Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. Being an architect, this may  have been uttered in a moment of self-congratulation. The expression “The Devil is in the details” soon followed. If we put it to a vote as to who’s really in there, the Devil gets nine times as many Google hits. In any event, it's awfully crowded down in those details. To Micromanage the world is like herding cats: it will keep you occupied and well away from more important endeavors, well-trained, tamed and domesticated. This Gua is a reminder that there are different scales in life. The value of the small scale diminishes when this polishing or refinement is overdone.

Notes:
Finding the optimum balance between what you want to do and what the world will allow, you are, in a sense, what you get away with. At least we have safety, mortality and extinction to keep us in check, and at least in this we are guaranteed one reason to cultivate some respect in our conduct.

11.G, From the Glossary
Tai4 (a, the) (free) interplay, harmony, peace, facility, prosperity, happiness, success, extravagance, affluence; grandiosity; smooth interaction; (to be) har- monizing, prospering, prosperous, pervading, exalted, honorable, superior, extravagant, flowering, flourishing, great, affirming, broad minded, liberal,  xtensive, large, permeating, pervasive, grand, most, extreme, interactive, safe, peaceful, tranquil; the west wind; (to) spread out, suffuse, interpenetrate, permeate, pervade, communicate (s, ed, ing); greatly

Note:
Peace doesn't really convey the core meaning of 11, even though this can occur within Tai. The core meaning  is closer to "everything working together in a greater good, as if this is how things should be." Peace may be a nice, positive state, but the word doesn't convey any sense of the dynamic energy and productive output of this exuberant interaction of forces. Synergy would be a better name if it wasn't so anachronistic.

12.M, Key Words
Disjunction, discontinuity, disengagement, pulling apart, alienation, indifference 
Denial, negation, division, schism, pettiness, aloofness, apathy, numbness, decay

 Ignorance, small-mindedness, lowest common denominators, leaders out of touch 
Stratification, abstraction, disintegrity, disarray, dissonance, disharmony, discord
 Non-participation, non-cooperation, negating and the need to negate, wrongness 

12.G, From the Glossary
Bi3 (to be) inferior, wrong, worthless, decaying, bad, stagnant, stagnating, disin- tegrating, alienated, inappropriate; (to) deny, refuse, stop, negate, disapprove (of), separate (from) (s, ed, ing); on the contrary; not, if not, or not, not do; (a, the) standstill, stagnation, separation, disintegrity, negation, denial, incoherence; [entropy]; what is not so; not, wrong; also pronounced fou3: to not be, if not, if out of

Note:
Obstruction is a poor choice of names in this context, even without the confusion with Gua 39. It may be a valid gloss for the word Pǐ (also pronounced Fǒu) in its broader usage in the language, but its use here betrays a misunderstanding of the forces at work in this Gua. These forces are moving in different directions, away from each other, not in opposition or confrontation. The core meaning is that we have a choice between the superior and the inferior, an opportunity to exercise our own good judgment and conscience, and to practice Selection, the neglected half of the evolutionary process. Bad is actually a fairly good name for this Gua, but drawing this does not mean that things will be bad. It is simply an opportunity to make a good choice.

Notes:
What binds us together here, our consensus or shared intention, is an important part of the core meaning of 13, since this is what defines the line between Us and that Fellowship over there, across the Great Stream. This is cultural anthropology then, and has, as its highest goal, to define the line that surrounds us all, the search for human nature and its proper realtionship with the stars that hover so high above our campfires, to borrow the image from the Da Xiang.

Note:
In the Shi Yi section, Gui1 Yan2, Belonging Here, is from the Xu Gua. The word Domain in my own Gua Ming translation comes from the Latin Domus, home. A Domine was the lord of a household manor, and by analogy, became a name for the Western deity. Dominion, then, is to lay claim to a domain, to own it, to make oneself at home in this part of the world. And, as with owning up to something, it implies a sense of taking responsibility. A deed or title may not be necessary to one who has control over what owning and valuing really mean in the end. Great Possessing, then might be a better name than Great Possessions.

15.M, Key Words
Due regard, respectfulness, to honor others according their merit; ordinary reality 
Genuine, unpretentious, unassuming, modest, accurate, realistic, honest, authentic 
Consistent, inexcessive; basis in fact, surety, solidity, firmness, stability, sobriety
 Curtailing the superfluous, parsimony; thoroughness, realism; rocks in the rough

15.G, From the Glossary
Qian1 (a, the) authenticity, respectfulness, respect, modesty; (to be) unassuming, authentic, respectful, yielding, deferent, reverent, humble, modest; deficient

Note:
Modesty is a little weak here as the Gua Ming, even though, ironically, this is the best translation of the word Qian as used in several of the lines. Several of the lines describe what is wrong with our conventional understanding of modesty, especially the disingenuous self-effacement. This understanding is confirmed by the Mawangdui Gua Ming, also Qian, which toadies and sycophants would use to describe themselves as Unworthy. Humility is weaker still, this coming much closer to the subject of 62. Honesty would be a better gloss for the core meaning of the Gua, and "tell it like it is" or "call a spade a spade" a better description. In the Da Xiang many translators drift towards saying the objective is to make things equal, to level things out. This is incorrect. The objective is to know them for what they are, to give a fair assessment. There is in this Gua a little bit of holding back or conservative reluctance to go too far in assessing things. Note that the unbroken line is back of center, suggesting reticence. See the notes at Gua 16 for contrast, where the unbroken line is ahead of center, suggesting readiness.

16.M, Key Words
Enthusiasm, eagerness, exuberance, willingness, zest, the joyful noise, inspiration 
Spontaneity, attunement, rhythms, consonance, synchrony; an optimum readiness 
Acting in a timely fashion; responsive movement; prepare, provide for, allow for 
Forwardness, predisposition, inclination, initiative, earnestness, encouragement 
Confidence, preparedness, contentment, satisfaction; using momentum and inertia 
Complacent, smug, self-indulgent; enthusiasm as Theos within, needing an outlet 

16.G, From the Glossary
Yu4 (to) prepare, provide, allow, (get, make) ready, prearrange, anticipate, pre- sume, make allowance(s), take precaution(s) (for); think beforehand; be happy, be content, rejoice (s, ed, ing); (a, the) preparation, preparedness, readiness, antici- pation; willingness, cheerfulness, enthusiasm, contentment; complacency, smug- ness, indulgence, swinishness, surplus, surfeit; responsive action, easy movement; excursions back and forth; (to be) prepared (for), ready (for); alerted, cautious,  areful; willing, content (to); comfortable, satisfied, at ease, happy (with); docile;  ile, remiss; preliminary, provisional; already, previously, beforehand; elephant- like, slow, heavy, ponderous, deliberate, inertial; in advance, in preparation

Notes:
There is a confusing ambivalence in the way Yu is translated, in a range from a thrilled enthusiasm to a weary or even smug complacency. Between these is a Readiness or a Preparedness to go either way, along with the flow. Maybe the key here is in the Tuan Zhuan's gloss of Shun Dong, Responsive Movement, which also handily accounts for the reference to music in the Da Xiang text. The unbroken line in the image leans just forward of center, perhaps indicating a slight predilection for forward motion, given the right excuse, just as 15's line holds itself slightly back in a more conservative position.

Note:
Without question, Following is the perfect Gua Ming here, but this only leaves us the task of unfolding it like a Chinese word and exposing its many dimensions to cover the proper territory of this Gua. Following should carry a broad set of connotations that include active, even aggressive, modes of following, such as tracking, hunting and pursuit. You can follow your gut or follow a hunch. It is not just doing what your deity's minister tells you what the deity tells you to do. To follow properly is to Succeed. It is not merely Following passively along: there is Thunder in the Lake here, and the movement is driven by a sensible pulse. The pulse occurs in time, like a drum beat, and ''following in time' is brought up in the Tuan Zhuan and described in the Da Xiang. Finally, the Nuremberg defense of "I was only following orders" is suggested in 17.6, where it follows that there are consequences to being someone else's consequence.

18.G, From the Glossary
Gu3 (a, the) corruption, decay, decadence, rot, putrefaction, worms (in food or the belly), toxicity, poison, pestilence; bad medicine, bad magic, slow poison, venom; fixation (s), stagnation, deception, guile, delusion, insanity; (glossed in guwen as chong M1519: worms, insects, reptiles); (a, the) renewal, healing, curing, purging,  etoxifying; [neurosis, toxic ideas, a closed mind] ; (to be) fixated, degenerating,  dteriorating, decaying. This is a janus word, meaning both to be poisoned and to  cue from poison.

Notes:
Fixing or Arresting Decay is a little peculiar here since the problems have come from things being fixed, arrested, stuck or stagnant in pathological patterns and thus decaying for the lack of refreshing movement and vitality. Correction, then, involves putting things back in motion. Gu is a Janus word in this context, meaning both toxins and the recovery from toxins. Historically, Gu was a dark magic poison: one put a venomous snake, a scorpion, a spider, a lizard and a centipede together in a bowl. Then the remains of the last survivor were used to make a slave, cause insanity or work evil (young boys make this kind of concoction all the time, though actual creatures used may vary). This is Bad Medicine: not fresh, not alive and not changing. The idea of correcting injurious fixations in one's own lineage may have been sensitive at the time in the light of traditions of filial piety and reverence for the ancestors. The Zhouyi authors might have been taking an opportunity to broaden the spirit of this tradition by calling it a form of respect to improve one's lineage and in the process become better ancestors ourselves.

19.G, From the Glossary
Lin2 (a, the) management, undertaking, oversight, responsibility, supervision, commitment, accession, prospect, project, prospectus; exalted approach; (to) supervise, oversee, manage, take command, take charge, commit (oneself), arrive,  ear, approach, go to, be about to, view from above, look down on, look in on,  ispect, condescend to, favor (s, ed, ing); (to be) temporary, provisional, ad hoc,  ner to, about to, on the brink of, imminent, at hand; [rolling up sleeves, getting  dow and dirty]

Notes:
The core meaning of Lin derives from its assocaition to the 12th Month of the year, the month of getting ready to really get ready to begin working on this new year's harvest, now a mere "eight months" away. But you don't work on it by counting the 8th Month's harvest so far ahead of time. It is untimely to step back and admire your work now. Fast Approaching is the busiest season in an agricultural community. It is Nearing the time to roll up the sleeves and get dirty. If you are not in motion yet then you are laying out plans of attack, hiring workers, clearing the irrigation ditches (see the Gua Xiang as a furrow in the Earth) and readying the equipment, hence the references to leadership and management skills, and glosses of overseing and oversight. Some people who draw this aren't farmers, but some kind of Accession, stepping up into a position of greater work or responsiblility, is indicated.

Note:
Guan is the same word found in Guan Yin, the goddess of compassion. Yin there means calls or cries, which are heard and felt, not seen. Guan, then, is attending with more senses than vision. Most glosses emphasize the sight, but the understanding of Guan here should be broader than this. Attending or Studying may work somewhat better for this particular aspect of Guan. The six lines trace a gradual improvement in perspective, from narrow to comprehensive, and in our access to alternative or additional points of view. Also important to the mix is the idea of being viewed, trying to see ourselves more objectively, which attends the gain of alternative points of view. Exemplary behavior, becoming a better, cleaner person is the flip side of earnest study.

Notes:
Many people will draw this Gua in a reading and wonder what punishment they may soon be facing. But thirty centuries ago the Zhouyi was written for the King, and then for the inner court, and so this Gua actually describes the process and ethics of administering or executing justice, not receiving it. The Yi is now in the hands of the common man, who might have a lot to feel guilty about, and in this case he might apply the recipient's perspective to himself, but this was not the original intent. The no-nonsense Eliminating Obstacles to one's intentions is reminiscent of Alexander's treatment of the Gordian Knot: you simply slice right through the problem. Today it may be argued that one of the great components of the crime rate combines the unfair, excessive, sloppy or biased formulation of the law with the seeming randomness or irregularity of its enforcement. Gua 21 recommends a different approach: simple laws with consistent and cogent enforcement.

Note:
As pleasant as Grace may be, is not a good Gua Ming. Only two slivers of the meanings of the English word Grace mesh with the core meaning of 22: the sense used in "social graces," and a grace of movement allowed by intense concentration or focus on what is nearby. The core idea is "vision that is limited to what is neaby," the Light blocked by the Mountain. This is nearsightedness, not in the pejorative sense of shortsightedness, but simply having a better view of the nearby than of the far away, and good reasons not to trust one's longer view of things. Think of politicians making long-term decisions with no real vision beyong the next election. Both the Tuan and the Da Xiang offer this caution. This is what is fashionable and shallow, but it's also what helps us to get along with each other, and sometimes some of the fashion and culture that comes out of it is worth keeping.

Notes:
If you look closely at a climax ecosystem you will see that the quantity of death and decay is exactly equal to the quantity of birth and growth. Recycling is mandatory. This may be humankind's least favorite of all the natural laws and the efforts we spend in its denial are truly staggering in scope. So there it is: we live one life, in a system that's much bigger than we are. We pile it up as high as we can, then watch it go back down. Some of us participate by returning the favors as we go, as if to pay our rent. They Consolidate and maintain their base of support. The truly noble support the people below them, the true noble has noblesse oblige, the noble obligation. The knives eventually come out for those who do not. The natural gravity gets an assist. The Gua Xiang is a too-tall tower, an affront to the laws of gravity if it lacks an adequate base, a picture of the Unsustainable. But the fruit has to rot for the seed to sprout, and the beast that's for dinner needs to be skinned.

Notes:
I would use Returning here instead of Return, since a verb is better at keeping processes in motion. As with notions of duality at the time of the Zhouyi's composition, there didn't seem to be quite as complicated or convoluted a notion of cyclicity as was later developed in Chinese culture, but enough of it was there in the turning of the Si Shi or Four Seasons, and observances were already marked at twelfth and twenty-fourth points of the year. This was the Rule of Heaven and this Gua marks what is perhaps its most signigicant transit, across the Winter Solstice, when the light began to Turn Around and Return. As such it would become a synecdoche for the entire cycle and the cyclicity of processes in general. But as a Gua Ming, Returning must also expand to include Returning to the Way or Path that is proper to humanity. In fact, the Tuan uses the word Dao here in this original sense, long before it became plastered over with all of the metaphysical nonsense. It doesn't even say where the path is: it assumes that deep down you know and know the way back.

Notes:
Artlessness or Guilelessness can translate both words in Wu Wang literally. This is about being true to your nature and ignoring whatever there is of culture that might get in the way of this. The Zhouyi makes a point of noting that this is not a guarantee that things will not go wrong, even if the converse is true and being Artful and full of Guile will generally get you into trouble. Zhuangzi proposes: "Perfect sincerity offers no guarantee." Things happen without reason or purpose, things happen by accident, although many reasons are made up in retrospect, especially to account for bad things happening to good people. Whole pantheons of deities are made up out of this. But a life lived simply to learn is superior to a life of pretending to know, and the odds generally fall in favor of the good-hearted. As an extra layer of protection against grave injustice, many societies add a presumption of Innocence or a benefit of the doubt for cases where questions arise, and the burden of proof falls on the accuser. People understand deep down that the violation of Innocence is a loss to us all, as it costs us our ability to trust. Without trust there can be no civilization.

Notes:
This Gua depicts assuming the reins of our beasts of burden and taking control in the building of wealth, dynasty, culture and civilization. This is the Gua of the builders, living for things that are sure to outlive them. There is a grand presumption here, the perfect counterpoint to 25, that we have a right to play at being gods if we can only command the wealth and property required to do so. Thankfully the gifted can still command cultural wealth and intellectual property, given sufficient access to "knowledge of prior ideas and past deeds." Clearly there is a conservative element at work here: great accumulation must precede great expense, and in managing this accumulation we re-encounter the same need for trust that we find in 25.

Notes:
Appetitive Behavior, the following of our Hungers, is one of our life's great givens. Abraham Maslow's "Hierarchy of Needs" may undergo a great deal of fine tuning over the coming centuries but its fundamental premise will remain: when we meet our lower or most basic needs, we are then freer to move on to meeting our higher needs. And in this freedom and moving on we often have an opportunity to choose what we want to need next. Of course the advertising industry has jumped into this with both feet, but those of us with De or character can find our workarounds and retain some control of our hungers. It doesn't really matter that this is a small minority: we all know that the prey far outnumber the predators.

28.M, Key Words
Inundation, saturation, surcharge, extremity, crisis, emergency, stress, pressure 
Encroachment, transgression, overload, live load, hurried adapting, resilience 
Surpassing, overwhelming, extraordinary, too much; going beyond, transition 
Peak experience, stretching limits, pushing envelopes; more than bargained for 
Excess, unleashing, abnormality, heavy matters, under strain, humbling events
 Going far beyond, greatly transcending, greeting something greater than yourself 

28.G, From the Glossary
Da4  (to be) accomplished, best, better, big, complete, critical, crucial, developed, enormous, entire, extreme, far, full, fully grown, good, grand, great(er, est), high, heavy, large(r), (very, greatly) important, long, loud, major, mature, more, most,  ighty, noble, noteworthy, old, overall, (more, most) perfect, pure, realized, ripe,  sasoned, serious, significant, strong, successful, vast, whole, wholesome, vital; a  lo of, full of, lots of; master-, (a, the) completeness, (full) development, entirety,  grad(eur, ness), greatness, growth, (great) importance, majority, vastness, whole- ness largesse, maturity; a great deal, (very) much, very; already, entirely, fully,  competely, greatly, thoroughly, wholly, en masse, well-; of (great, crucial, vital)  imporance
Guo4 (to) go beyond, go past, exceed, surpass, transcend, miss, stray from, pass (by, over); bypass, get by, transgress, trespass, stray, err, inundate, predominate, exceed proper limits; (s, ed, ing); (to be) passing, transient, errant, past, in excess,  xtreme, exceptional, too much (of), excessive, beyond, above, overly, unusual,  etraordinary; greater/larger than; (a, the) error, transgression, fault, excess (ive- ness) (s); will err; to a fault, to extremity, to excess, to extremes

Notes:
When the Exraordinary happens we adapt, we become what we need to become. Rules that once demanded obedience might mean little or nothing now. It's OK to jaywalk to escape a collapsing building. Amusingly, the Zhouyi uses the attraction between men and women separated by their ages as an example or metaphor for such Force Majeure, ancient forces that are far beyond our limited comprehension. The Ridgepole might symbolize the highest expectation we have of our need for protection, but our insurance against being swept away completely is still measured in probabilities and all contingencies can never be covered. We can only expect, when that day comes, that we will have to leave what used to be.

29.G, From the Glossary
Kan3 (a, the) pit, pitfall, hole, cavity, snare, trap, canyon, chasm, defile, gorge, depth, precipice, grave, risk, exposure, danger, dangerous position, dangerous place, crisis, exigency, critical situation; gravity; water necessity (s); (to) trap,  ntrap, bury in a pit; (a, the) pit’s, canyon’s, chasm’s, risk’s; (a pun)

Notes:
Rather than simply overreacting to the words Peril, Danger or Abyss, try asking instead: what is it that is deliberately and enthusiastically sought by people who climb about in these deep canyons and boat right through the white water rapids. There is a full-hearted commitment to the process of surviving, to the passing of this trial. There is a great simplicity in having most of our options removed by serious constraints to the path or the route ahead. The senses sharpen, the heart pounds, the whole being responds to the challenge by waking up, being more fully alive. It's a Risk, but it's life learning more about life and what it is capable of.

30.M, Key Words
Radiate, diversify, individuate, glow, distinguish self; depart, go on; energy cycles 
Fire, flame, light, ignition, sunlight, beauty, radiance; transformational processes
 Coherence, moment, presence, attention, sentience, intelligence, enlightenment 
Dependence on fuel, relying on place and conditions; photosynthesis, metabolism 
Temporally conditioned consciousness, dependent arising; appearances, seeming
 Inherent in & adhering to conditions; instance, existence, articulation; continuum 

30.G, From the Glossary
Li2 (to) rise, arise, radiate, diverge, separate, contrast, depart, differ, digress, part, get distance, distinguish (from, out of); articulate, leave, spread out, stand out, move on, abandon, choose (one), decide, part, cut, divide, distribute, arrange, set  ut, pass on, pass through, hang down, hang from (s, ed, ing); (to be) distinct,  dfferent, diverse, diversified, divided, separated, off, away (from), distant, apart  (fom), without; pendant, dependent, dispersed, independent (of); (a, the) arising,  reaising, departure, removal, distinction, divergence, division, separation, dis- tance, difference (from); radiance, display, fire, flame, firelight, highlight; net; vis  a vi each other; a bird, esp. an oriole (colorful contrast); figure ground relation- ships; the root of the English word "existence" is to stand out or stand forth;  "WhenLi birds sing, silk worms grow" (Shuowen)

Note:
Li4, from the Tuan Zhuan, also means beautiful or elegant, as well as clinging, dependent, or conditioned. Li4 Li2 then means Beautiful Arising as well as Dependent/Conditioned Arising. This version of the idea of conditioned arising arose before the arrival of Buddhism in China. The two Li's are almost opposite in meaning, as if reversed in their direction. One is the convergence of forces that led to this moment, the sunlight that got locked up in the plant that the cow ate and turned into beef and milk. This is what is depended upon and why we care for the cow. The other Li is that light lighting up again, in the mind of the one who dined on the cow or her milk, and then to continue to radiate outward, diverging in the various activities of the day. Li Li, thus and in a word, is the fourth dimension, past and future, as these light up in the present moment, in the intelligence and consciousness that is sunlight on the move again.

31.G, From the Glossary
Xian2 (to be) joined, conjoined, united (in, with), in touch with; moved, touched, persuaded (in, by); together, altogether, all, every, mutual, shared, concordant, convergent, integrated, complete, full, finished; everywhere; (to) feel, sense; join,  onjoin, unite, put together, reciprocate, touch, come into contact, move, embrace,  sare, come together, convene, converge, complete (s, ed, ing) (in, with, toget- her); (a, the) feeling, sensation (s); persuasion, reciprocity, mutuality; entirely,  fuly, completely, wholly; (also used for gan, 3232, to stimulate, influence, at- tract)

Notes:
The core meaning of Xian combines two Western ideas for which the West has just the right words: Eros and Symbiosis. Unfortunately they don't combine into a single, recognizable idea and the words just don't sound very authentic as a Gua Ming. This Gua uses eros and libido as a general metaphor for the will to interact with the world and live a fertile existence. Clearly the fertility part works best when mutuality is involved and the attraction is reciprocal, and this is the hard part. Attracting another to a the degree that we ourselves are drawn requires attractive behavior, courtship behavior, even good or our best behavior. Getting out of one's self and into something more fertile is the subject matter of the lines.

32.G, From the Glossary
Heng2 (a, the) duration, continuity, continuance, endurance, steadiness, constan- cy, consistency, longevity, sustainability; (what, that which) endures, survives; (to be) regular, enduring, lasting, chronic, continuing, persistent, persisting, continu- ous, perennial, perpetual, prolonged, constant, throughout; (to) last in, go on, en- dure (changes), continue, persevere, stay, perpetuate, prolong (s, -ed, -ing); always; constantly, lastingly, persistently, continuously, regularly, perseveringly

Notes:
One might expect a book called the Changes to have an interesting take on things which persist through time. Western ideas have been influenced for millenia by Greek notions that cannot permit perfection to coexist with change. The Western gods themselves are denied the ability to change or grow, and ultimately, even to move, because that would imply a prior, imperfect state, unthinkable in a divinity. In the Zhouyi a thing can only survive by adapting as its existence progresses. To endure, unchanged, in a fixed state, is not Duration but delusion. Continuity endures, history itself endures, original bearings and principles can persist, genes can get passed down generally intact, but anything that is real is going to have to rub up against other realities and get altered in the process. A thing merely continues until it is unrecognizably altered.

33.M, Key Words
To retreat, step back, detach; strategic pullback, withdrawal, neutrality, abstention
 Issues of freedoms from and to; retire a debt; retirement, sabbatical, sabbath, rest 
Seclusion, refuge, sanctuary, asylum, reserve, haven, safe distance, out of reach 
Retraction, resignation, quitting claim; inaccessibility, discretion, disengagement
 Escaping, transcending, reframing; taking a larger point of view, a bigger picture 
Neutralizing, letting go, standing down, stepping back, getting away, evasiveness 

33.G, From the Glossary
Dun4 (to) retreat, withdraw, retire, escape, evade, avoid, flee, hide away, withdraw from, get distance from, step back (from), run away, abscond, skulk, hide; drag the feet in walking (s, ed, ing); (a, the) retirement, retreat, reservation, sanctuary;  istance, distancing, withdrawal; [reframing]; (to be) hidden, concealed, evasive,  wthdrawn, invisible, secluded

Notes:
Tactical or Strategic Withdrawal sums up 33's core meaning better than Retreat, even though Retreat is the best translation of Dun in most of the lines. For any problem we encounter there is an optimum Distance from which it may be successfully addressed. As Einstein said, "The significant problems we face cannot be solved at the same level of thinking we were at when we created them." Dun is movement in search of that optimum distance. This might be jumping up one level of abstraction, or fleeing to higher ground, or just getting the hell out of an impossible dilemma. Now, as to the Pig or the Piglet as Gua Ming, this is an artifact of academia, where polysemy in the classical Chinese language is not officially recognized. The solution to the problem it poses simply requires getting some distance from the academic world, just as the little pig will try to get distance from you and your butcher's tools.

Notes:
This Gua illustrates the difference between Power and Force. In scientific terms, Power is the rate at which energy changes form. It often has little to do with force. Where work is to be done, efficiency or efficacy is an important measure and wasted energy is merely entropy. Therefore, resistance to applied force is only a measure of power when heat is the desired result. The symbolism makes good use of a big, pushy, butt-head ram or billy goat, wielding what he hopes the ewes or does will mistake for power. But this is only power when noise and nuisance is the desired result. Real power is in the lack of resistance, in the opening or opportunity, the hole in the fence, in the hole for the axle, in the still place, in the pause, as the Za Gua suggests, where the opening is found.

35.M, Key Words
To advance, progress, develop, improve, grow, circulate, open, warm, thaw, dawn 
Acknowledge, demonstrate; energize; emergence, discovery, disclosure, exposure
 Enterprise, venture, free markets; learning by way of freedom, liberty, permission 
Overt, sunny, healthy, vibrant, generous, outgoing; daylight, daytime, sunshine 
Openness, assent, acknowledgment, opening up, glasnost; present, offer, promote 
Character, virtu, self-development; growth too temporary, healthy to be parasitic 

35.G, From the Glossary
Jin4 (to) advance, progress, grow, develop, extend, prosper, increase, improve, enter (upon), make progress, lead, introduce, present, insert (s, ed, ing); (to be) forward, advanced, far along; (a, the) growth, advancement, progression, pro- motion, development

Notes:
In natural ecosystems, inputs of free energy tend to fuel the system's self-organizational capabilities. Sunlight almost always tends to make them more coherent as well as more robust and diverse. This principle also operates in laissez faire or free-market economics (an ecosystem quite distinct from corporate capitalism). The prosperity alone is sufficient to enable the system to run itself, as if by Adam Smith's Invisible Hand. The "Classical Liberal" approach to both wealth and liberty is in fact a good part of the subject matter of this Gua. Transparency and sunshine laws can also be inferred. Both Advance and Progress are problematic here as Gua Ming, specifically for their ease of confusion with Gua 46 and 53, while Prosperity and Fluorishing can be easily confused with 11 and 55. The word Expansion avoids this confusion.

Notes:
While the circumstances that surround this Gua might recommend or suggest that one's light be dimmed, hidden or shielded, this is not really an image of this light being defeated, wounded or damaged. The process of Darkening the Light is proactive: it is done deliberately, as a stratagem. Covert Intelligence, in fact, is a viable, literal translation of Ming Yi, and a couple of instances of its use are described in the lines. Disguise is used in the lines as well: a man feigning a limp, and a bird feigning a broken wing as a misdirection, and a prisoner feigning insanity (a reference to an historical Chinese Hamlet). Also useful here is the notion of banking the coals of a fire, reducing its rate of combustion, to allow the flame to last through the night.

Notes:
The Chinese name Jia Ren suggests that the subject of discussion is the Family's People or Members (Ren). This is what we are concerned with here, not simply the Family or Household (Jia) as a unit in the larger society. Family Members may sound a little more awkward, but it is both more literal and more to the point. The text goes on to discuss the various roles and processes within the family.

Kui2 (to be) estranged, separated, distant, weird, dissociated, divergent, foreign alien, separate(d), removed, polarized, contrary, unusual, strange, opposed, in opposition, diametrically opposed; (a, the) disparity, estrangement, separation,  olarity; eyes not aligned, moving separately

Note:
On opposite ends of the spectrum, in oppposite parts of the sky: these are really the only senses in which the word Opposition applies here. Opposites, therefore, would be a more useful Gua Ming than Opposition. The character Kui seems to depict eyes that are somehow discomforting to see, either wild, or strange, or rolling, or glaring, or staring off in different directions. In any event there are two things here that are unalike, as are the constituent Ba Gua of Fire and Water. The image of eyes that are doing different things might suggest the phenomenon called Retinal Disparity: the two eyes that share one head have different points of view. They send different pictures to the brain. We don't mind, though, because the brain uses the differences to constuct its perception of depth. As an analogy, this extends readily into both cultural and biological diversity, where depth is also a function of divergence. It can even be used to support freedom of speech and the value of a free marketplace of ideas. We merely have to get beyond the discomfort of other people disagreeing with us.

39.M, Key Words
Impediment, delay, detour, complication, inconvenience, drawback, immobility 
Hindrance, holdup, barrier, obstruction, obstacle, interruption, discouragement
 Discontent, stationary period; convoluted route, reorientation; options narrowing 
A closed mountain pass, waiting out the storm; lowering expectations and goals 
Redefine goals for achievability; detoured but not deterred; ability to compensate
 Knowing when to stop, consolidate progress to date, rethink directions and plans 

39.G, From the Glossary
Jian3 (a, an, the) impasse, obstacle, impediment, drawback, setback, obstruction, difficulty, misfortune, fault, holdup, detour, limp, complication, handicap; (to) go lame, limp, walk lame, stumble (s, ed ing); (to be) halting, hobbled, proud, arro- gant, impassable, obstructed, complicated, set back, held up, detained, deterred,  nterrupted; defective

Notes:
The word Impediments works best in integrating the various "foot problem" meanings of Jian. Interestingly, the word "scruple" was a pebble in the shoe, preventing one from going forward. My word Impasse means unable able to cross the pass, and this is from the Bagua configuration of Water over the Mountain. A key observation here is that the Impasse is not permanent. The big problem here is one's own sense of urgency. If this can be set aside, then sideways, at least for a time, is a perfectly viable direction. One might even find the festive comanionship of others, even that of a sage, off in that new sideways direction. It is suggested that the capacity for such acceptance might be a function of one's maturity.

Like the nautical tool called a fid.

Note:
The Xu Gua and Za Gua gloss Jie3 as Huan3, Letting Go, Loosening, Slackening, Release. The radical in the character Jie3 is "Horn." This is derived from a "knot horn," a tip of antler or horn that was worn at the waist and used frequently in those days in the untying of knots. Release then (or forgiveness) is the untying of the knots that we have got ourselves into.

41.M, Key Words
Diminish; to reduce, economize, forego; contraction, concentration, conservation 
Sacrificing, offering up; dues, service, subtraction, trying to lose only inessentials
 Trimming excesses, plugging leaks, lowering expectations, doing more with less

Enrich, make less dilute, keep the good stuff; building resilience; losing negatives 
Extenuation, distraction, depreciation, demands on resources, use, wear and tear 

41.G, From the Glossary
Sun3  (to) belittle, chastise, cut (back), criticize, cut down to size, damage, harm, injure, decrease, destroy, diminish, dwindle, economize, lessen, lose, reduce, trim, spoil, subtract, weaken, wound (s, ed, ing); (a, the) concentration, contraction,  ecrease, detriment, diminution, loss, reduction; (to be) concentrated, contracted,  dcreased (by), diminished, lessened, reduced, taken from, weakened; detrimen- tal, disadvantageous

Notes:
The Zhouyi authors play with the notions of Decrease and Increase in a manner that foreshadows Laozi. The two are inextricably interrelated, in ways that seem almost mystical. A time of Decreasing is an opportunity to practice Economy, in the good old sense of the word, before it came to mean conspicuous consumption, profligate waste and planned obsolescence. The ability to reassess what we really need and want, even when learned involuntarily, is a skill that creates personal wealth. Gratitiude of course is an important key here, and the Zhouyi even recommends such a "sacrifice."

42.G, From the Glossary
Yi4  (to) add, advance, augment, benefit, enrich, expand, fill (up), further, gain, give, grant, grow, increase (by), progress, promote, profit, reinforce, replenish, restore, strengthen (to) (s, ed, ing); (a, the) addition, advantage, augmentation,  enefit, enrichment, expansion, gain, gift, grant (of), surplus, overflow, increase,  pofit, value; (to be) beneficial, gainful, profitable, increased, advantageous, aug- mented, progressive, restorative, useful; expansive, rich; additionally, more, all  th more, expansively, further, increasingly; more and more

Note:
By extension of the statement in Tuan Zhuan 41, Yi4 as Increase can be described as Xu1 (The Behavior of) Lack or Want. It is the action of Nature abhorring a vacuum. Increase or Increasing is good enough as a Gua Ming, but the word Gain has an interesting additional meaning that is worthy of note: the sense used in signal gain. It is possible to increase the amount or rate of input simply by becoming more open or sensitized. It does not need to be increased at the supply, broadcasting or donor end of the transaction. This is analogous to appreciation, making a thing more valuable simply by valuing it more, or by putting it to a more valuable use.

Guai4 (to be) decisive, resolute, certain, committed, resolved, decided, serious, determined; (to) determine, decide, resolve, commit (to), indict, execute, cut off, censure, displace, purge, uproot, eradicate, divide, part ways, make a breach (s,  d, ing); (a, the) disclosure, resolution, decision (to), decisiveness, satiety; cer- tainly, seriously, decisively, resolutely

Notes:
As with many of the Gua with prominent single lines, the Gua Xiang, or Hexagram Shape, contributes much to the core meaning of 43. It was likely seen as portraying an excess of the sort of affect that can move one to actions that are later regretted, indignity perhaps, hostility, anger, or simply obsession. One may be about to blow one's top, or maybe go over the top in a response. The various texts suggest a calmer, more rational and probably more effective approach: state the problem clearly, study its extents and ramifications, and begin to clarify the solutions. Resolution can be a good Gua Ming here. It has a set of meanings that describe great determination or firmness, but it also has the meanings used in optics to refer to the detail or sharpness of an image which returns us to the rational study of the problem, so that good choices are made, so that one's decisiveness isn't bound to a bad decision. Part of this is not being overfull of oneself. Thus the Da Xiang recommends spreading pieces of the problem around and sharing the solution. Maybe let the courts handle it.

44.M, Key Words
Interference, extenuation, attenuation, dissipation, distraction, complication, chaos 
Chance encounter, casual relation, affair, fling, indiscretion, seduction, temptation 
Entropy, randomness, undermining influence; squandering or adulterating order 
Mental promiscuity; coincidences taken too seriously as omens; loss of judgment
 Deferring, prioritizing, restraining self, abstaining; waiting for a meaningful affair 
Interposition, insinuation, persuasiveness; happening upon, accidental rendezvous 

44.G, From the Glossary
Gou4 (to) couple, pair, connect, mate, copulate, meet (with), pair (up) with, come in(to) contact with, come in(to) conflict with, encounter (s, ed, ing); (a, the) (chance) encounter, (temporary) affair, (ad hoc) coalition; temptation, seduction,  issipation

Notes:
As fun as the symbolism of the temptress or seductress may be, this Gua really isn't (necessarily) about the sexes or their battles. Nor is it about empowered or liberated women, even though women who may fancy themeselves as such will almost invariably seize upon this notion. This is just a metaphor that the authors used. It's about the good fight against Dissipation or Entropy, which describes both life and intelligence. Nothing is more distracting to higher purpose than a sudden attraction to the opposite sex. The symbolism was irresistable. The gist of this is advising resistance to, or restraint against, an encounter or influence that threatens to undermine our higher purposes in an untimely fashion. There may also be cases (as in two of the lines) where this is not all that untimely and in fact might really be a beneficial distraction from excessive concentration. This is especially true where an unexpected sexual encounter might contribute much to one's mental health. Many or most of our modern day readers seize upon the Tuan's phrase Nu Zhuang, "woman of/with power," and can see no further than an apparent affirmation of women's liberation. They are blinded to the very next line of the text. In fact, a women moving under her own power would be written Zhuang Nu, a powerful woman. A Nu Zhuang, on the other hand, is given the power: to seduce, dissipate, or undo the higher order.

45.G, From the Glossary
Cui4 (to) gather, assemble, unite, collect, bring together, pull together, bundle, cluster, convene, integrate, concentrate (s, ed, ing); (a, the) gathering, assembly, assemblage, congregation, collection, crowd; security, unification, collectedness,  elf-possession, confidence, assurance, composure, reintegration, integrity, concentration; bunch, bundle, cluster, multitude of grasses; (to be) thick, close-set,  dnse; “pulling it together,” “holding it together,” “having it together”

Note:
This Gua Ming should make clear the distinction between 45 and 08. Both have Water over the Earth. The difference is that 45 is contained on all sides, and its banks, or embankments, or dams, are constructed for a purpose and require maintenance. The image of a bank is appropriate as the Gua texts refer to setting things aside, making preparations for the unknown, insuring future outcomes. The character Cui may depict bundled sheafs of harvested grain. There exists a common, archetypal image of a bundle of arrows or sticks having properties of strength and durability that single arrows or sticks do not. This is often used as a symbol of the power of unity and solidarity. It is also known as the Fasces, an important symbol to the Roman Empire and to Nazi Germany. Note implied caution. Congregations, especially those of religious institutions, will Gather Together for security and comfort in solidarity. The point may be in the illusion of "having it all together" or simply collecting one's wits, banked against the vagaries of fortune and other scary unknowns.

46.G, From the Glossary
Sheng1 (to) advance (on, upon), promote, ascend, climb, arise, rise up, rise above, move upward, go up, step up, improve, mount, lift up, accumulate, save; issue forth (s, ed, ing); (a, the) advance, advancement, promotion, improvement, ascent,  limb, step, increment (s); a measure of capacity; [to invest in potential energy]

Notes:
The word Sheng might have started out as a measure of volume capacity for produce and grain. As such it would have been tallied in integers and so it eventually came to refer to other discrete increments, such as stair steps. One more step brings us to the meaning of Climbing or Ascending, with steps being the measure of our Advancement. The core meaning of Gua 46 isn't very mysterious. But there is also an element of boldness in ascending or stepping up, and here the Zhouyi advises us to face South, the direction the King faces when giving commands. Also present is the the notion that advancement is something earned. Further, increases in elevation mean the acquistion of potential energy that can be spent in various ways like currency. This is a good Gua for the educational process, or otherwise becoming increasingly proficient in a skill.

Notes:
Exhaustion is probably the best Gua Ming here. This is the Gua of haunted houses, the spooky Gua. Nietzche said: "When we are tireed we are attacked by ideas we conquered long ago." There is much wallowing and mournful self-indulgence depicted in the lines, but the advice that runs throughout the text between the lines is to lighten up. The language is teasing, and mocking in a playful way. It uses caricature and parody. This is also the wordiest of all the Gua, as Gua 58 is the briefest. As Francis Bacon wrote: "The pencil of the Holy Ghost hath labored more in describing the afflictions of Job than the felicities of Solomon."

Note:
The perfect Gua Ming for 48 is simply The Well. The most obvious of the associations belong here: it is a Source, of replensishment and refreshment. It must be cared for and maintained. It's pretty useless if the rope isn't long enough or the bucket is broken. But in the Early Zhou The Well also symbolizes Common Ground, the Commons, and what we now call "the tragedy of the commons." It occupied the central parcel in the allocation of land but was not itself privately owned. As such, it is what we have in common, the resources available to us by virtue of having human nature, animal nature and life. The Xu Gua says Fan3 Xia4, Back to the Lowly or Back to Basics. The notion of encouraging reciprocity, or working together, suggests an interactive relationship with providence, as in "The Lord helps those who help themselves." The Well is a device, but we are its only moving part.

Notes:
While Political Revolution and Culural Revolution are both central to the meaning of 49, these are still not as fundamental as Celestial Revolution, the revolving of the great wheels, the Earth, the Sky and the passing of the Four Seasons. Most of what exists attempts to resist the changes brought to us by Time, since life is negative entropy, and so when things do not change continuously they must be changed more discontinuosly. We cling to the old and outdated as long as we can, and then find that we must surrender them abruptly in order to catch up with the time. Also central to the core of Ge are the images of shedding skin and molting fur, protective coverings that have outlasted their usefulness.

50.M, Key Words
Crucible, tripod, a sacrificial cooking vessel; consecrated or dedicated offerings 
Dedicated change, change by design, science as art; applied heat and knowledge
 Refinement, sublimation, purification, alchemy, the great work of transformation
 Symbol of dynastic foundation & creative power; nourishment of ability, nobility 
Pragmatic utility, specific utility; excellence by design, instrumentality, formulae 
Realizing potential in raw material, social engineering, creation of higher culture 

50.G, From the Glossary
Ding3 (a, the) cauldron, sacrificial vessel, tripod, (ritual) ding vessel, crucible, (consecrated, dedicated) transformation; [alchemy]; (a, the) cauldron’s

Note:
The Cauldron is the perfect Gua Ming for 50, but as with the Well, the Zhouyi's other technological artifact, the broader connotations of its use need to be unfolded and incorporated into the core meaning. The tripod base is imporatnt as it is the simplest, most stable foundation that an artifact can have, and the handles, the practical issue of accessibility, occupy half of the lines. It would be fair to say that this Gua is about Cultural Alchemy. It is not precisely correct to call the vessel a Sacrificial Cauldron: it's purpose and function are more closely related to rituals of Dedication or Consecration than sacrifice. There are higher purposes being served here, in feeding the most noble among us, the best among us, with the best that we have to offer: to transform us and our culture into something better than it is today. The Ding is thus closer in meaning to Crucible or Forge than it is to Vessel. In fact, it is the Alchemist's "Great Work": the transformation of mankind. The Tuan Zhuan uses Xiang4, Imagining, Modeling, Representation, perhaps feeding with a design in mind, nourishing to a higher purpose. The Da Xiang offers Ning2 Ming4, Manifesting or Realizing Higher Purpose.

51.G, From the Glossary
Zhen4 (a, the) shock, thunder, shakeup, excitement, arousal, stimulation, force, power, energy, vibration, movement, motion, quake, terror, awe, unexpected; (to) shake (up), excite, stimulate, quicken, rouse, arouse, motivate, move, marshal;  nspire, frighten, shock, startle, scare, alarm; tremble, vibrate, lift, quiver, dust off  (, ed, ing); (to be) shaken, shook up, excited, roused, aroused, stimulated, moved,  moivated, frightened, startled, scared, alarmed; awe inspiring

Note:
The Chong Gua, or the eight Hexagrams that are formed by doubled Bagua, do not carry precisely the same meanings as their constiuent Bagua. The Bagua depict energies of qualities of energy. They are simpler, more direct, unconscious, raw. In the Chong Gua they become self-aware, they incorporate feedback and learn about themselves, and this has consequences in the behavior depicted. Gua 51, then, refers only in small part to the first shock or peal of thunder, or to the startled reaction: of even greater interest here is what happens with the second. Subsequent maturity, or the learned response, is a central part of the meaning. The Tuan Zhuan mentions Zhu3, (Resultant) Mastery or Authority, and the Xu Gua the Zhang3 Zi3, the Eldest Son, the voice of experience where depicted elsewhere in the Yi.

52.M, Key Words
Check, restrain, resist, confine, delimit, define, discipline; to hold against change 
Straightforward, forthright, honest, present, steadfast, anchored, rooted, grounded 
Concentration, introspection, reflection, meditation, quietude, self-containment 
Prepossession, reserve, balance, stability, equilibrium, poise; the matter at hand 
Touchstone, paragon, terminus; silence, resting, inertness; presence, self mastery 
Pressures building to not be still; self-examination; backbone, integrity, principle 

52.G, From the Glossary
Gen4 (to) still, check, limit, restrain, constrain, prevent, confine, arrest, define, resist, be obstinate; keep still, just be, hold steady, balance, rest, set, settle, quiet, suspend (s, ed, ing); (a, the) restraint, confinement, definition, boundary, setting,  bstacle ahead, stillness, equilibrium, rest, [inertia]; stiffness; opposition, hos- tility; (to be) outspoken, straightforward, candid, blunt, simple, honest; refractory,  subborn, obstinate, perverse

Notes:
The ongoing search for equilibrium is a pervasive drive in our hierarchy of needs. Homeostasis keeps us within the range of circumstances that our vulnerabilities allow us. It is not incorrect, and maybe not even anachronistic, to call some of the behavior depicted herein an early form of Yoga, meditation, or even Zazen. The concern for the spine, as analogous to a range of mountains, is central to the ideas of poise and balance. One supposes that the more dynamic forms of Maintaining Balance, such as Aikido and Jujitsu, would be appropriate here as well. Gravity is befriended here. Gravitas, a dignified equilibrium, has its utility as well. It's a little peculiar that this is called the Youngest Son, for whom playing, making mistakes and telling lies seem a better fit. Perhaps we can infer from this that the young nobility in the Early Zhou were frequently told to Keep Still and pay attention.

 Constancy, tenacity, endurance; procedures to follow, proceedings, conventions
 Incremental growth, maturation, development; a longer process, one day at a time 
Accommodation, patience, meeting criteria of place, due process, rites, protocol 
Wild goose as symbol for long-term fidelity and commitment; following the order
 Practicality, day to day progress, slowly and surely, a progressive conservatism 

53.G, From the Glossary
Jian4 (to) advance gradually, increasingly, advance by degrees, go little by little, go bit by bit, go steadily, make gradual progress, make steady progress, pace one- self, progress gradually, develop into; seep into, soak, saturate (s, ed, ing); (a, the) proceedings, formalities, details, protocol, patient progress, (gradual, steady) ad- vance, progress; (to be) next, slight; gradually, increasingly

Note:
Gradual Progress might be the best Gua Ming here, although Gradual Development eliminates some potential confusion of Progress with 35 and 46. It does indeed make progress, going little by little, towards a worthy and significantly distant end. Pacing ourselves would be a better description than exercising patience, although that is also required. There is a commendability to the length of one's vision here, to the far-ness of the horizon, in the distance to one's ends: deferred gratification is a hopeful sign of maturity. The image of the slow-growing tree on the mountain calls to mind the ancient and gnarled Krumholz trees that live near timberline. The Ten Wings also use Jin4 to gloss Jin4, the Gua Ming of Gua 35. But in the Tuan Zhuan here it is Jin4 Yi3 Zheng4, Advance With Correctness, implying formalities or requirements to be fulfilled or realities to be accommodated.

Mei4 (a, the) little sister, younger sister, maiden, virgin, girl, daughter of second wife, step sister; young sister’s, little sister’s

Notes:
Undeferred Gratification, Jumping the Gun and Jumping to Conclusions at least belong in the core meanings or keywords collection here, even if they are too anachronistic for Gua Ming consideration. Humanity has been doing this for a very long time - it's a legitimate and ancient archetype. The image in the metaphor is of a young girl either marrying ahead of her older sister, or simple Marrying in Haste in order to get ahead. The long-term consequences of this haste aren't seriously taken into account. It is in a lot of ways the opposite in meaning to Gua 53. A sobering look ahead at the mischief that such impulsiveness makes is earnestly prescribed as a remedy, but the lines depict other mature approaches as well.

This Gua depicts the (usually short) period of time spent at the Zenith of prosperity, amidst an excess of busyness and confusion, and just before things start settling down again. Micromanagement is unthinkable - one barely has time for all of the major Executive Decisions that need to be made. The images of polarized light used in the lines refer to the sort of tunnel vision that is required. There are hopes of getting out of here, or hopes that this will pass soon, but the Sovereign in the Tuan has no choice: this is his element. For those who have taken entheogens, this time may be likened to the very peak of the experience, just before the world begins to resolve again.

56.M, Key Words
Traveler, stranger, itinerant, peddler, newcomer, visitor, guest, disciple, pilgrim 
Walkabout, vision quest; perpetual novelty, insecurity; caravanserai, inn, shelter 
Portability, light travel, roughing it, going native; ad hoc life, living without a net 
Earning a welcome; tact, wit, modesty, self-reliance, versatility, a few good tools 
Dynamic equilibrium, self-sustaining systems; the tactics of intrusion, diplomacy 
Varieties of people who wander, as a source of uncertainty, curiosity & suspicion 

56.G, From the Glossary
Lu3 (a, the) wanderer, traveler, itinerant, guest, vagabond, stranger, wayfarer, visitor; wandering; order, sequence, arrangement; backbone, spine, strength; (to) travel, drift, wander, sojourn; dispose, arrange (to be) temporary, provisional,  d hoc; wandering, traveling, visiting, itinerant; a unit of 500 troops

Notes:
The Knight of the Road has many names, across the spectrum from worthless bum to pilgrim, or fugitive to circuit judge, or thief to traveling salesman. We just don't know who this stranger is, or how much benefit of the doubt he should get. In ancient Greece, the gods Zeus and Hermes would disguise themselves as poor itinerants and go door-to-door testing the tolerance, charity and character of their people. You never knew if the stranger in front of you wasn’t in fact one of the unknown gods. The benefits to the wanderer here, and what a social treasure this myth was, should be obvious, but the wanderers, as the world's most loosely formed guild, need to keep it up, against destrucive forces within their own ranks. Gaining right entry into an unknown place is another of the central themes here. Further, there is a comparison with 55 to add an insight: just as 55 can accomplish little, even with the benefit of having very much, 56 can do much while having very little. In fact, anything more than the barest sufficiency only becomes a burden to carry.

57.M, Key Words
Penetrate, insinuate, encroach, conform, comply; gain admittance, entry or access 
Nichemanship; occupy, adjust, adopt, adapt, conform, submit, accommodate self 
Fitting in, fitness; subtlety, resilience, shape shifting; persuasion, sway; reconsider 
Finding a path of least resistance; asserting without aggression, subtle persistence
 In-formation, to assess before following through; learning and teaching processes
 Reconnoiter, many-angled approach; rethinking, thinking twice, second thoughts 

57.G, From the Glossary
Xun4 (to) penetrate, enter, gain admittance, gain entry, gain access, reach into, insinuate, coax, wheedle, infringe, infiltrate, influence; adapt, conform, yield (to); submit, resign, accommodate; take (place, form, shape); withdraw (s, ed, ing); (a,  he) entry, access, penetration, adaptation, encroachment(s), admittance, adapt- ability, accommodation, conformance, versatility, finesse, subtlety, resilience,  [lasticity]; (to be) submitted to, put into, adaptive, adapted to, accommodating,  sumissive, following, subservient, docile, humble; versatile, opportunistic; withdraw or retreat to go around, with no intention of giving up; also pronounced Sun4

Notes:
In the Gua Ming shown in the table above, only the Wind aspect of the Bagua Xun has been used. Green wood would have been just as instructive. This is the delicate fiber of root that finds it's way into the crack in the stone below, that over the years will grow to split the stone apart. This is an insinuating influence, that advances by feeling its way along lines of least resistance. Our understanding, or our minds, can be said to penetrate the world in this way, slowly, through trial and error, eventually getting things figured out. But this is not just a Bagua here. Xun happens twice. The first reaching out is tentative or provisional. We get a feel for something, or formulate an hypothesis. We write a first draft and pass it around. We look for the mark's tells. We get some feedback and adapt our ideas, and then try again with a little more confidence. This is the Gua of thinking twice, of the learning process that adapts as it explores.

58.M, Key Words
Free, open up, clear out; barter, bargain, negotiate, weigh, exchange, pay, redeem 
Enjoyment, pleasure, happiness, delight, relish, relief, gratification, self-interest 
Harvest, reaping rewards, fruits; compensation, incentives, persuasion, satisfaction 
Hedonics, pursuit of pleasure and happiness as intrinsically benign and instructive 
Encouragement, desire, attraction, welcome; charm, enchantment, bewitchment 
Ananda, eros, cheer, epicurean hedonism, need/want as driving force in evolution 

58.G, From the Glossary
Dui4 (a, the) joy, pleasure, happiness, satisfaction, delight, gratification, rejoicing, openness, exchange, mouth, passage, opening, aperture; (to be) open, free, clear, acquiescent, accepting, glad, happy, fond of, responsive, oral; (to) exchange, pay,  arter, deliver, give an equivalent, trade, transact, weigh, share; open a passage  trough, open up, clear away, convert, gratify, rejoice; speak (s, ed, ing); [consen- sual behavior, voluntary transactions]

Notes:
Dui is much more than just Joy. The right name should capture most of our more Pleasurable and Agreeable feelings: delight, gratitude, love, happiness, sympathy, eagerness, rapture, ecstasy, even the sacred forms of sadness. There is a wisdom in Pleasure and Satisfaction that can maintain enough sense to stay out of trouble. The Greeks who founded the philosophical school of Hedonism knew this well. Reasonableness does not have to be a stranger to Pleasure. But they realized that Pleasure and Happiness were not the thing to pursue. These were simply what happended, or how it felt, when we were traveling our proper path, in Chinese, our Dao. There is another core aspect to the meaning here: mutual consent, negotiating with others, or bargaining to optimize the benefits of exchange to ourselves. Adam Smith had lots to say aboout how we all come out ahead in this way. Dui, of course, is also a naughty little slut who wants to be spanked.

59.M, Key Words
Distribute, disperse, disseminate, propagate, dispel, diffuse; to broadcast, as seed 
Dissociate, disincorporate, sublimate, dissolve, dissipate, rarify, diversify, expand
 The mystic’s truth, reintegration with a higher unity, ecstasy, surrender, embrace 
Changes of state: melt, dissolve, evaporate, evanescence; subtlety, metasolutions 
Disintegrate, reintegrate, a breakup or breakdown of structure; reunion, salvation 
Transcendence, metamorphosis, sublimation, opening up, letting go, going to seed 

59.G, From the Glossary
Huan4 (a, the) diffusion, sublimation, distillation, evaporation, rarifaction, broad- cast (as seed); [change of state]; (to) disperse, scatter, distribute, disseminate, dis- pel, break up, disintegrate, dissolve, clear up, relax, relieve, melt, vanish, diffuse, evaporate, flow in scattered directions, rarify; fade, relent, give way, succumb (s, ed, ing); (to be) slack, broad, swelling, wide, scattered, diffuse, evanescent,  ispersed, volatile

Note:
Both the Xu Gua and Za Gua use Li2 as a gloss for 59, even though this is also the Gua Ming for 30. It is used here strictly in its sense of coming apart, expanding outward, diversifying. This Gua tells of a change of state, from lower to higher, solid to liquid (melting) and liguid to gas (evaporation), a breaking up of the less fluid forms. This may be the closest the Zhouyi comes to describing the Mystic's experience, and both the Tuan and Da Xiang texts have strong spiritual overtones. I have used Scattering as Gua Ming, with deliberate Sufi connotations. Life really is about going to seed, casting ourselves into Time's winds: the Sufi's little stream crosses the desert by surrendering to the sun and and becoming a cloud. The Zhouyi authors may not have formulated theories on the latent heat of fusion or the enthalpy of vaporization, but they knew what took the heat off.

60.M, Key Words
Limitation, abridgment, articulation, definition, order, discipline, discrimination 
Terms, terminus, stipulation, condition, restraint, constraint, regulation, stricture 
Economy, moderation, self-control, measuredness, budgeting, thrift, allocation 
Due proportion, proper balance, ethical measure; the golden mean or middle way 
Systems of moral regulation and division, measured steps, discretion, specificity 
Epicurean hedonism, good taste with rational choice, caution, intelligent selection 

60.G, From the Glossary
Jie2 (to be) restrained, constrained, moderate, temperate, controlled, articulated, limited, regular, defined, definite; (a, the) limit, restraint, constraint, limitation, regulation, (regular) division, rule, law, moderation, temperance, control, discipline, term, boundary, condition, articulation, article, joint, node, knot, period,  ime, degree, detail, section, segment, juncture, chapter, abridgement (s); (in due,  dly) proportioned, in proper balance; (to) regulate, discriminate (s, ed, ing)

Notes:
The character Jie was originally an individual joint in a stalk of bamboo and carried the idea of regularity and incremental growth. It eventually carried the suspicion that Limitations and Boundaries were the sine qua non of any kind of viable growth: in baby steps. Even when we are being enormously ambitious, a healthy awareness of our Limitations and Boundaries is the most productive place to begin. It's the structure that we have to work with: without it we overestimate ourselves and underestimate the world, and we fail in our ambitions. The most useful way to remove our limitations seems to be to know them first, the pep-talkers and positive "thinkers" notwithstanding. The maxim "Know Your Measure" comes to us from the ancient Greeks. It was seldom advised for purposes of preventing growth. We might suspect that our words proportion and ratio might somehow be connected to the words proper and rational.

Note:
It's a little unfortunate that Truth gets stuck in our sentences as a noun. Archers, carpenters and wheelwrights at least get to use True as a verb, where it means a great deal more. The Zhouyi uses the phrase Be True a lot, though only once in this Gua. Significantly, it never once tries to tell us what truth is. It's fun to think that it's telling us: "You know what truth is, or at least you know what is true. You just need to stop telling those lies." Zhong Fu, as The Truth Within, or Core Truth, is the opposite of absolute truth. It is truth at the personal, local, familial, or relativistic scale. This leaves great streams that still need to be crossed. We are not born with an understanding of what it's like to be a pig or a fish. We aren't born with knowledge of what it is to be someone or even anyone else but ourselves, but the closer we get to the family or the familiar the better our guesses can be. After a long, silly detour into delusions of ourselves as tabula rasa, our better scientists are resuming the search for a human nature. We can find some of that portrayed in the Zhouyi's archetypes. Gradually we expand our understanding of who we are.

Notes:
The Tuan Zhuan explains that it's the small that are in excess here, not that that the excesses here are small, but this has escaped many of those who have tried to translate the name Xiao Guo. Here is a big clue to the core meaning: the smaller the species in stature, the more of them get born. The prey have a lot more babies than the predators. The sad fact is, even if you are a human being who fancies himself at the top of the food chain, you are still expendable. There are all sorts of substitutes available to take your place. It is up to you to pay attention accordingly. With you being just one among many, you may need to settle for less, and show some respect for natural laws, such as gravity. This Gua is much closer than 15 to the meaning of Humility. There is nothing wrong with humiliity either, it's great stuff. It lets us feel admiration, wonder and awe.

Note:
It's with both tongue-in-cheekiness and irony that this Gua is placed before the end of the sequence. It still means that what has consumed so much of our attention will no longer consume as much in the same way, but it's time now for things to start falling apart. It's time to start maintaining the thing, or start packing away the memories, or embellishing the tale. It's time for the anticlimax, or even some bathos. Lasting perfection is not available to us. The Tuan Zhuan suggests Dao4 Qiong2, The Path Peters Out.

Notes:
Here again we have a statement being made in the sequence: here we are at the end and still we're not done yet. It's even left unclear just how far we still have to go: the words here do not say "almost across." But this is a wonderfully dynamic state to be in. If things cannot remain in this state then they most likely will not: Natural Law itself pushes us onward. Paying careful attention is central to the meaning as well, as both the Tuan and Da Xiang advise. At least we are built for this: the mind is made to wake up for novel stimuli, and attention seeks out the unfamiliar, if only in order to pin everything down and go back to sleep. It isn't likely that the meaning is derived from the concept of the "incorrectness of an odd line in an even place." More probably it derives from the Bagua, Fire over Water, Attention and Intelligence over Risk and Hazard.

Introduction

    The Yi tells us that a good Cauldron needs a good handle, that a good Well needs a long enough rope and a bucket that doesn't leak. In both cases, these symbols are most useful when they are accessible, when they can be grasped, when you can get a grip, and when you can retrieve what you need from the ground or the fire. The Gua Ming or Hexagram Name is the first and most obvious way to get a grip on the coherent sets of ideas that each of the Hexagrams represents. It is therefore to our advantage to clear up some of the great confusion that has grown up around them.

    It might be useful to introduce this within an outline of the five main areas or branches of Yixue or Yi Studies, with the most time spent on the second, Core Meanings, of which Gua Ming is a subset. This is also an opportunity to lay groundwork and offer some context and concepts for a broader grasp of the subject.

    1) Cumulative Experience. This begins when someone first tosses the coins and might lead all the way up to the writing of books on the subject, and then, if fortune smiles, rewriting those books with more wisdom later. This is a body of personal knowledge that can take many decades to build and consume many thousands of hours. It is also easy to waste a great deal of this time in following less than excellent leads or studying frivolous approaches. Here are three ideas that may help in our understanding of this problem:

    Bricolage: Construction or creation from a diverse range of available things. We build our bodies of knowledge as we go, with what we find at hand. Unless there is a set curriculum for the long term, as there is with some skills or trades, a body of knowledge is normally a personal thing, personalized in the layering of newer experience over older layers. But this is often like laying a foundation before we know what the building is going to look like. Looking back over the process of creation, with what we know now, we would not likely have built the thing the same way. It would have been done more rationally and been better planned. Many classic examples of bricolage are found in our cultural and technological evolution. The odd number of feet in a mile comes from a thousand double paces of a Roman army on the march, and yet as irrational as the number 5280 is now, the United States refuses to adopt the much easier metric system. There is too much cultural inertia. Even the distance between modern railroad tracks derives from Roman chariot wheels. We have a ridiculous alphabet, that derived from a long line of other ridiculous alphabets, but we won't supplant it with a better system of phonetic representation. no matter how much this would add to our literacy. We go on making spelling a huge challenge, with more exceptions than rules. The Kabbalists, instead of investigating the wonders of human language, are stuck with trying to justify their own silly alphabet as the mysterious anatomy of HaShem.

    Confirmation Bias. Favoring information that confirms our preconceptions or hypotheses. As a body of knowledge builds it gains in inertia or resistance to change as well. We will tend to turn away, often with prejudice, from any new source of information that offers explicit hints of a conflict with our beliefs, and we will reinterpret both our experience and our memories to confirm what we already think we know. This is why bodies of knowledge often evolve in fits and starts: the contradictory data first needs to build up enough pressure to overwhelm the standard models. This is related to the larger idea of apperceptive mass, the whole of a person's previous experience that is used in understanding a new percept or idea. This in turn helps to explain why the Yi calls it "worthwhile to cross the great stream,' extolling the virtues of getting outside of ourselves and our familiar niches, of getting a new, more global perspective.

    Unlearning. To expunge, erase, delete, efface, or overwrite something that we once thought was the answer. This is much harder than learning, partially because it is so hard on our egos. We have made an investment that may need to be accounted as a loss, and we fear that this means being accounted a fool. We have wired uncountable neuronal connections into our wetware. How do you unwire this? You can only pay greater attention to something better, and this means you may first need to recognize or acknowledge something better. This is from experience. I wrote my first Yijing book in 1976, and it took a dozen years to be thankful that it never got published. Due to rising personal standards over the next thirty years I had to rewrite the whole thing three more times. These weren't simple revisions. Each time meant many dozens, even hundreds, of instances where I had to put the stink-eye on some favorite passage or insight I'd written down and admit "Boy howdy, did I ever have that one all wrong." I still have a nice folder full of orphaned witticisms that have nothing at all to do with the Yi. This is why I don't feel entirely unqualified to make this statement: Most of the kids who are playing in this field would be well-served by setting aside or even discarding most of what they think they "know" about the Yi and starting over, with beginner's mind, a few guiding principles, a little logic and critical thinking, a handful of reputable translations and commentaries and access to the Chinese text. Maybe one could think of any years of study invested before this new start as warmup or practice for a real run at the problem. This does not mean that things discarded or set aside now cannot be later recovered, after an honest reexamination. But the human mind, after making even a minor and half-hearted investment in study, wants to think it's "been there and done that" and now it's all figured out and time to get praised for its wisdom, while the Yi just shakes an imaginary head at such foolishness. It's hard sometimes to upend the Cauldron. We feel compelled to defend our invested opinions even from ourselves. I have long suspected that the name Changes was actually an inside joke for the authors. The book changes as we grow.

    What the above three ideas suggest is a caution and a conservatism in study that feels utterly alien to a hungry, young mind. Who wants to start on somebody else's 'right track' and stay there? Carefulness is something you learn later, not when you are starting out and are immortal and know everything. The best we aging classicists can do is point to the rock and roll gods who began with classical music training at Julliard. This is all about having a good foundation, built in a meaningful place, and a good working knowledge of the pre-invented wheels available to us. This can advance us more quickly to the creative frontier.

    The point of this is not to discourage branching out in the subject, or to prune everything down to a single trunk. The subject of the Yi is still not close to being fully surrounded. There is still a lot of room for individual expression and creativity. But very few of the unique and original contributions are supported on foundations built out on the lunatic fringe of the field. The original thinkers' points of view are still at their most valuable when they contribute to our understanding of what the Yijing is about at its core: clarifying the human experience in a methodical, comprehensive and communicable way. A classical foundation in Yixue uses a vocabulary that has been developed over millennia and is shared by most of its serious students. Out on the fringe new ideas can be discovered or made, and new words for them coined, but the one who develops his own entire vocabulary will usually just wind up babbling to himself, or at best found a short-lived school that is soon forgotten.

    Many people have had success writing books on the Yijing for the mass market and yet have needed to exercise no judgement whatsoever on the quality of their input materials. They will still be well-praised on the back cover. And others have reached their Autumn years with a great body of cumulative experience that for reasons of peer pressure and peer review has been limited to sources in the academic world. At most the academics have been allowed one point of dissent from the body of consensual understanding, which of course would be the thesis they are tasked to defend. Ironically, it's at these two extremes, and not the middle way, where the social acceptance lies. Pity the fool who writes a critical book with multiple original ideas for intelligent readers.

    The bottom line is this: respect your brain, if not the tradition: garbage in, garbage out. The recommendation: start or restart the studies with well-respected books in the field, and with carefully done translations of the original text instead of knockoffs and gimmick books written for mass-market, new age beginners. Get a good grounding in the original before studying the commentaries, or else read the commentaries with a much more critical eye. They will at best provide only a slice of a text's overall meaning, like a blind man's description of the elephant.

    2) Core Meanings. Imagine a large, extremely complex piece of terrain that you want to divide into 64 parcels or homesites according to their nature or characteristics. The landscape has something for every taste or type: cliff to flat, inundated to desert, old-growth forest to mined-out wasteland, tropical to arctic. You can't really use a rigid grid, although many might try, and you can't really draw clear, sharp lines between the between the parcels because ecotones, like analogies, usually have fuzzy edges. Let's call this terrain "The Human Experience." You will do this mapping using a number of survey stakes for each of the tracts. This point looks like a 13, tap, tap, tap, even though somebody else on the crew has hammered in a 37 stake too close by. That one can be sorted out later. Let's do a few passes first and see where this wants to take us, in Aboriginal terms, to see what this land wants to dream.

    This process evolves over a long period of time and you see the patterns start to emerge, even though the patterns still have their fuzzy parts, and too many bozos are just running around setting stakes according to channeled and psychic advice instead of studying the land. If you can ignore this last bunch, which means using your judgment and suspecting that not everybody's "truth" is equally valid, then you can at least start drawing conclusions about the core descriptions of each parcel, those areas where there are the fewest ambiguities, trespasses and boundary disputes. From there, to there, to there, is all unquestionably 13. Each of the 64 zones of the Human Experience has a number of identifiers, key words, in Chinese and from other languages all around the world, buzz words, cultural memes, even music jingles and artwork. Ultimately you cannot pick just one or two of the stakes for a comprehensive description: those stakes define points and lines, not the field. The full collection of these concentrated and least-ambiguous descriptors, those with the least overlap, the entire suitcase full, is what we will be calling the Core Meaning. The grip or handle on that suitcase is the Gua Ming. It is selected from the amongst larger collection. It wants to be taken from very close to the center, for good balance. It also wants to imply as much as it can of the rest of the contents. Above all, it does not want to be mistaken for the handle of another suitcase.

    A Gestalt is an organized whole that is perceived as more than the sum of its parts. When a collection of associations and points of reference reaches a critical mass it will seem to take on a life of its own, an emergent dimension of wholeness that exceeds the parts in its content. It is no longer a set of discrete points in a field: it becomes a field containing a set of discrete points. We are now able to set our own stakes, and where these are set between two known points, we can have a higher degree of confidence in them. We can start to tell stories that connect the dots. Creativity is engaged. The word Core comes from the word heart. When we get to the heart of the matter we see it come to life. Core Meanings are deceptively simple but they are also multidimensional gestalts that require a great deal of time and patience to ponder and understand. The gestalts contain the words of the text, the meanings and implications intended by the authors, the gleanings to be had by examining the dimensions of meaning and construction that were actually used by the authors, a large number of cultural references and historical allusions, a number of insights to be had from wordplay and the etymologies of Chinese words, and a number of different levels of depth. Many of these components are things that some author somewhere has praised at the "key to it all," but I think they work best in combination, just as the gestalt is more than the sum of its parts.

    Ramified meanings, as distinct from Core Meanings, are much more elaborated, numerous and complex. They come from several sources: the Wing commentaries, newer dimensions like "correctness" and even yin-yang theory, invented by later scholars, redactions good and bad, translations good and bad, commentaries good and bad, and one's own personal body of experience gleaned from feedback in divination. The biggest problems with ramified meanings are low signal-to-noise ratio and their heavy reliance on pure imagination out at the far periphery of a text's usefulness in divining our world. The text meanings really get stretched in the process of answering some questions, and these stretched meanings can be far from central or germane. They're just too flabby. All of that is in addition to there just being a whole lot of utter crap in print out there. It's in the search for a core meaning that we can hold forth the criteria we need to judge the difference between the good and the useless: otherwise what do we use to weigh the value of what we pick up, besides whether or not it's something we want to hear?

    To use another analogy (which we do a lot of in this field), think of Core Meanings as our stem cells and the ramified meanings as the hundreds of kinds of differentiated cells that we have in our bodies. Note that when life goes to propagate an organism it does not build one by starting with large numbers of pre-differentiated cells. One single cell is enough every time to make the entire organism. There is a great economy in that process. Similarly, when you have the core meaning of a text you don't have to drag a massive amount of baggage to the reading. The core meaning is your swiss army knife. That they are easier to use, however, does not make them easier to find, and impatience is the big problem here, the inability to sit still and let the Yi speak and its meanings form slowly. Most students take the opposite approach and when the deeper meanings don't jump out at them right away, off they go chasing this or that Xiangshu dimension or calendar correspondence or new-and-improved method of interpretation. They do more to avoid the meaning than seek it. And they do this without any real criteria to weigh the value of what they find. People have been talking nonsense about the Yi for so long that folks now expect it not to make any sense, as if it's supposed to sound mysterious, cryptic and unintelligible. Modern scholarship has only made this problem worse with its twitching captives and grunting hamsters.

    There are three main alternatives in selecting a Gua Ming to represent the Core Meaning or gestalt. The first is to simply use the Chinese term and allow it to have all of the associations that our cumulative experience affords it. Learn to pronounce it properly, though, or suffer some embarrassment later. The second choice is to translate the name literally, using the most comprehensive and informative glosses available. The third is to translate it according to the central theme of the Gua, or to translate what it means instead of what it says. Take 15, Qian, for instance, frequently named Modesty. The word is used throughout the text in contexts best translated with the word Modesty. But in these contexts the Zhouyi is being highly critical of the pretentious, disingenuous self-effacement that is Modesty as commonly misunderstood, Modesty that seeks to make everything equally mediocre and unworthy. In fact, this Gua is recommending Authenticity, to understand and appreciate things exactly as they are, even if if this means calling attention to some truly great thing that you have done. Authenticity is marginal as a literal gloss for Qian, just as Modesty is marginal as a name for 15's deeper meaning. It becomes a question of personal taste. My own choice was to be as literal as I could but insist that the deeper meaning come through, particularly since I still had the ability to translate the word literally in rendering the remainder of the text.

    A large number of the Gua can be named easily and perfectly in English, notably: Following, Biting Through, Returning, Decreasing, Increasing, The Well, The Cauldron and Gradual Progress. Ironically, this can be a real problem. These names may need to have their envelopes stretched quite a bit in order to accommodate the broad range of meanings that they are intended to encompass. We need to recover the diversity within that simplicity. Sometimes we really need to climb inside theses words and spend some time walking around in them to see where they take us. It might be helpful, for example, to read a couple of articles on how to build and maintain a Well, while looking closely for any metaphorical or analogical connections that might present themselves. This is second best to physically climbing down into a well during a drought and cleaning it out. Then you will really understand the first two lines.

    Many people never get beyond what the given Gua Ming alone tells them. If it is suggestive of something bad or negative, then this Gua is bad or negative and you don't want to draw it in a reading. It may not even matter to them what the text says after this. But as long as someone is locked into thinking of any Gua as inherently positive or negative they will never understand the Yijing. The Yi itself tries to explain this in a number of places: Gua 12 is an opportunity to be rid of inferior influences; Gua 41 is a chance to learn the skills of economy, thrift and gratitude that will make you truly rich when the times turn around, if not before; Gua 39 is a chance to look sideways from linear thinking and goal-seeking behavior, to seize upon what we might have missed; Gua 05 learns to live in the moment and maximize the meantime. And so on. Aleister Crowley put it this way: "Imagine listening to a Beethoven concerto with the presupposition that C is a bad note and F is a good one. You would clearly miss the music." Good hexagrams vs bad hexagrams is shallow thinking that completely misses the multi-dimensional richness of understanding that the Yi has to offer. One way to get out of the habit is to start asking the question "What is the upside of this?" when we think we have a "bad" reading, and just as importantly, "What is the downside of this?" when we think we have a "good" one. The same goes for the lines. It helps a lot to think of every line as representing a choice of attitudes, not a literal prediction, but a recommended posture that is often implied by the depiction of an inferior posture. So if the character in the line is in trouble and getting his nose cut off, we try to remember that our question is about where we are going: we should use this information and simply decide not to go to a place like that where they are apt to cut off your nose.

    Finally, it should be noted that having the core meaning might not be in the least bit useful in understanding a particular reading in the context of divining. The response that is being sought in the divination process might just as easily be found in a particularly bad translation or commentary, or in an entrenched misunderstanding in our personal body of knowledge, or in some private association we have to some random word in the text, or in reading the wrong page, or even in the page number. Having the core meaning might increase the odds of discovery somewhat in the divination context, but it's more to the point that its study increases the understanding itself, or the odds thereof. It is not the end: merely the most fruitful place to begin. In the context of divination it may help to think of the Core Meaning as the base or headquarters of an organized search, or the center of an organized search pattern. The answer to a question might ultimately be found out on the Easternmost fringe of the Ramified Meanings, but starting in the center will in the long run give better results that consistently starting somewhere on the Westernmost fringe.

3) Zhouyi Yili. The term Yili, Yi + Li, is perhaps best translated as Meaning and Principle. Zhouyi Yili is the study of the Zhouyi text for its meaning and utility, or for its psychological, behavioral and ethical advice. It's relevance to Gua Ming and Core Meanings is obvious. This is often contrasted with another branch, Xiangshu, Image and Number (see below), that looks instead at the Yi's mathematical and geometrical structures. In short, Yili asks what the Zhouyi or its authors were trying to tell us: what meanings they were intending to convey. We run instantly afoul here of several of the popular waves of contemporary philosophy, notably, post-modernism, post-structuralism and deconstructionism: "Communication is imperfect and unreliable, even a myth. We can never know what the authors were intending to tell us. Cultural differences render everything mutually unintelligible. We must avoid that slippery slope and all fuzzy logic and dismiss the unreliable. With the authors and their so-called intentions now out of the picture, the only meaning we have left to us is in what the words do to us and what we make of that, as solipsists." Fortunately, students of Yixue are steeped in a tradition that goes back three-thousand years and across this span we can see three-thousand years of wreckage of fads and fashions such as these, strewn behind the words of the text and their intended meanings, even when some of these fads hang on and hold majority and "official" support for centuries. There may be more slip-ups and pratfalls in using the slippery slope fallacies than there are on the slick slopes themselves. Humor me and assume this for now: the authors intended the text to have meanings and those meanings can be at least partially recovered, even in distant times and cultures. If language wasn't adequate to share meanings, then we would not have human culture. That there is no such thing as perfect, objective meaning doesn't mean there is no such thing as meaning, or that some meaning cannot be shared.

    However meaningful, the texts of the Zhouyi are not made to any kind of point. They are not like instructions for baking a cake. They were intended to serve as responses to a nearly infinite variety of questions that had not been asked yet. Obviously there was a lot of ambiguity and ambivalence that had to be built into the text. Any meaning there was would need to be of the plastic or stretchable kind. I have elsewhere made the distinction between vertical and horizontal ambiguity. In the former is the flexibility to reframe and jump to new points of view and levels of abstraction, the latter is simply the potential to be self-contradictory. The Yi's great strength is in the former. It does, however, play with the latter in one important respect: the situations depicted in the Gua and the Lines always represent as much of a choice as they do a prediction, omen or oracle. As stated above, there is no good or bad per se. If a scene depicted in a text illustrates dire happenstance or consequences, even if no alternative is discussed, then the advice may be still be taken as a warning to avoid such a scene, or plan a better way out. A particularly harsh or frightful "prediction" does no more than say: Look how bad this could get if you're really stupid. You can avoid this by not being stupid, and what a sublime success that would be! On the other hand, the promise of a promising outcome is also a picture of what you have to lose here if you manage to screw up the time. The Yi's answer, in the end, is always: Do this, or don't, but look at the options. Aside from this use, the Yi's ambiguity is made for reframing our perceptions and perspectives.

    The human mind, and specifically, our associative cortex, is truly astounding in its ability to make some kind of sense and meaning out of just about anything. This does not, of course, mean that this sense and meaning have any connection to reality, even internally. But evolution seems to have constructed our minds around the ability to make connections and associations. When we draw forms and information from dimensionless fields, such as a whiteout, a ganzfeld, or white noise, we call the talent Apophenia. When we draw forms and information from mere or simple suggestions of form, as with tea leaves, entrails and clouds, we call the talent Pareidolia. The Yi is located just a short way up this scale from pareidolia: the images and stimuli it uses have considerably more original order than clouds, at least after the decades of study required for the images to make any sense. Skeptics may well level charges of ambiguity and pareidolia at the divinatory arts, but this need not be a call to some kind of defense. I suspect that these charges should be embraced as a partial description of how the divinatory process works. It makes use of the human mind in a manner consistent with some of its basic cognitive processes. Apophenia and Pareidolia can make use of an active interface between the suggestion of form and meaning and elements of the sub-conscious just waiting for a little illumination.

    Metaphor has had a lot of critics over the centuries. Scientists, engineers and philosophers like to look down their noses at it: It's a liberal art, a mere humanity, something for fuzzy-minded poets. It's imprecise and playful. Not only that, it's a cultural artifact, and one that comes late into human culture. In fact, many of the Yixue scholars in academia might assert that this literary device was still culturally unavailable to the authors of the Zhouyi. Instead, they had a kind of concrete, naive realism. The images that they used were merely substitutes for seeing actual omens in real life, to be interpreted according to the simple superstitions of the day. Perhaps if they looked a little beyond their noses they could also fail to see metaphor in the Book of Odes or Poetry, a contemporary of the Zhouyi. To use a metaphor here: this is just horse shit. Cognitive neuroscience has been very busy, for some decades now, destroying the smug pretensions of metaphor's critics and finding metaphor at the very heart of the great bulk of human ideation, conceptualization and language, even up to and including that last bastion of Platonic perfection, mathematics. Conceptual metaphors, constructed largely of sense memories or sensorimotor schemas, are the building blocks of much of our thought. And to make things extra sloppy and poetical, when we recall some sensory datum to use in our lofty world of ideas, we are dragging the contents of our emotional recall along with it. Up a notch in scale, we create the larger structures of our thought by comparing analogies, crossing domains to other fields, in search of consilience. Joseph Needham's disdain for correlative thought as a barrier to science ultimately falls apart, even though his examples of its failures are well-chosen. There is more to argument from analogy and correlative thought than science would like to admit. We get our idea of force from kinesthetic receptors in our muscles, of particles from our vision and touch. And where we lack the sense to make sense of things, as with reconciling the particle-wave paradox, or imagining dark matter and energy, or seeing time being space turned sideways, or getting our heads around spooky-action-at-a-distance, we just seem to flounder and start licking ourselves like frustrated cats.

    One of the theses here is that the pictures painted by the words of the Zhouyi text are intended as metaphors for broader cognitive and behavioral patterns in the human repertoire. We can use the word metaphor here as a synecdoche for the whole range of comparative literary devices: sign, symbol, euphemism, archetype, metaphor, simile, caricature, synecdoche, analogy, parable, model, allegory, up to and including whole correlative systems of thought. A word on archetypes is in order here, since Carl Jung's thought has been so much abused in this field of Yixue (let's not get started on synchronicity). Jung described these archetypal images as inherited, and therefore encoded within our genetics, shared by the species as a whole, and originally unconscious, or originating in some sort of collective or shared unconscious. It is embarrassing how many people in our field jump in a single hop from collective unconscious to universal consciousness and see the archetypes "out there" as some sort of Platonic ideals floating around in a more perfect world. Closer, I suspect, to what Jung meant (and to some degree stated) is that we are genetically predisposed or have inherited predilections to sort our experiences according to specific social roles and behavioral categories that relate to getting our specific (Maslovian) needs met. The roles are the social types vital to our survival in the tribe: mothers, fathers, siblings, elders, allies, heroes, bullies, cowards, alphas, sycophants, infants, etc; and the categories are behavioral types: treachery, alliance, xenophobia, seduction, dominance, flattery, obligation, commiseration, submission, grooming, etc. As our lives progress we will flesh these predilections out with our cumulative experience into coherent models. The mechanism is still unknown, but it is assumed that this must be simple enough to encode genetically and in no way confuse the orangutans, chimps, bonobos and gorillas that seem to be born with them.

    These archetypal models are at least as numerous and complex in humans as those that we see in the behaviors of "unschooled" primate societies. There is clearly much more to primate social organization than the culture of the tribe. This collection lives primarily in the old primate brain that we all still share. There are slight differences between species, as with gestures and facial expressions, but in general there is enough common ground even here for a basic mutual understanding. Those who have spent significant periods of time "across the great stream," as the Yi exhorts us to do, know that humans across the globe have much common ground, despite our cultural differences. Now, just as cognitive neuroscience is exploding our snooty ideas about metaphor being inferior to the purer forms of conceptualization, evolutionary psychology is "deconstructing" many of our recently cherished notions of the human mind as a tabula rasa and human culture as primarily or fundamentally relativistic. We are beginning to inquire again into the structure of human nature, and to ask what parts of our behavior still underlie the diversity of our cultures. The pendulum is returning with some cogent force. Cultural variation on innate or native themes still represents most of the data to be sorted here, but even this is no longer the polemic of nurture over nature that has occupied us of late. We are better prepared to see blends and interactions of the two.

    If we can hope that the Core Meanings refer to more universal or archetypal roles and behaviors, then we can start looking for broader applicability as a sign that our comprehension is nearing the core. The Yi's images are often concrete and specific, using the nouns in our everyday life. Given the range of questions to be asked of these "answers," we can only assume that these are symbolic and metaphorical, and only on occasion to be taken literally. References to women, for example, and the damage they can do, are frequently symbolic of larger processes in life. For example, the distractions from our higher purposes and commitments, that seem to come upon us at the least convenient times, to undermine all of our better values and leave us dissipated, have no better symbol that that of an unexpected encounter with a hot seductress. Gua 44 is about these distractions, the threat of dissipation in general, and the need to exercise some restraint. Sometimes this can can refer to a real woman. But it can also be a bribe, or greener grass somewhere. To take the metaphor literally, and then compound the error by thinking this Gua is all about women's liberation, is to miss the core completely. A gestalt is quite different from having a definitive explanation of what the line means. It does not stand around the outside of the meaning, it occupies it from within. It represents an outlook on life, with as many variations are there are paths to be traveled. We cannot do that by seeing the images as concrete things before us.

    The above brings us to the question: What proportion of the metaphors (etc) used by the Zhouyi's authors were specific to the culture they lived in, and how many pointed to more universal human archetypal roles and behaviors? A clue might be found in the book's three-thousand years of continuous popularity, to which we can now add a couple of centuries of leaps into widely different cultures and significant popularity even there. There is a resonance in this popularity that reaches far beyond early Zhou culture. Further, for those of us who can imagine the authors trying to share meanings, and not simply to appear profound and obscure, we can imagine them wanting to offer something that we could recognize. To the extent that they were trying to communicate, they would have been looking for universals and common ground. And to the extent that these authors knew that their composition was itself evolving over the span of a couple of centuries, they may have been looking for images that sustained their relevance in the face of local cultural changes. That is, they may have wanted to minimize cultural relativity in favor of human universals. Now, obviously, the images are culturally nuanced, and not lightly either. The meanings of the Zhouyi's images absolutely require a study of their culture of origin, and preferably of the earlier versions of the language as well. But this hypothesis at least opens a door for psychology, neuroscience, sociology, economics and anthropology to have a peek inside. Finally, there is an unevenness to the actual length of Zhouyi texts, which will vary from two characters to a couple of dozen. I have elsewhere asked if this might be due to centuries of attrition, prior to the book's canonization. It could be that any chunks of texts that were dropped over the years were simply not universal enough, that they were too culturally relativistic and had become less relevant, leaving the more universally relevant images behind.

    It has been fashionable for many decades now (at least since Shchutskii in the 1920's) to point out that the Zhouyi texts were written in two or more layers, with an assumption that these layers were set down at different times by different people. The first is referred to as a divination text or mantic formula (the various prognostications and exhortations) and their predecessors may be found in OBI's or Shang Dynasty oracle bone inscriptions. The second was referred to by Waley (1933) as "omen or peasant interpretation texts," which texts are the metaphors we refer to here. I have called this whole hypothesis into question (Vol. I, pp 6-8) and suggested at least holding an opposing view open: that the texts were written across the same span of time, by the same group of people, but drawing upon elements of vocabulary from a couple of separate sources. This alternative, even if it fails to be upheld, has an additional advantage: it asks us to examine the entire Gua or Line text as an integrated, continuous, seamless whole, knitted together, with a comprehensive gestalt or core meaning that accounts for every single word of the text. It asks us to try refusing to see the texts as disjointed conglomerates of independent statements. Even if this only turns out to be an exercise in pareidolia and creative stitchery, it has turned out a lot of rewarding results in my own studies. There is a converse of this as well: if our grasp of the Core Meaning fails to enable us to stitch every word in the text together as a unified whole, then we have a sign that we still have work to do on our gestalt, that our puzzle is still missing pieces. All of the words, every single word, should make sense. And multiple statements made within a line should not appear to be disjointed or separate utterances. If the phrase "No Blame" follows a metaphor, it will be clear why those words were used. If a minor word or particle doesn't seem to fit then you don't have the core meaning. You can't just do like Rutt and others and ignore the particles when they don't fit in with your big idea. Old Chinese grammar is more fluid and flexible than ours, but it is real and every word of the text serves a purpose.

   Contrary to the rules observed by modernist scholars, and the ironically named "context criticism," it is a legitimate exercise to use the context of the Yi to understand the Yi, the context of the word to understand the word, and the concordances of the words as they are used throughout the text to understand their often varying meanings throughout the text.

    Each of the Yi's 384 Yao Ci or Line Texts has a Core Meaning or gestalt as well, but although they have a nomenclature (e. g. 01.1 zhi 24 or 01.1>24) nobody has ever tried to name them. We can make good use of a reciprocal relationship between these and those of the Gua in developing both. Perhaps a majority of readers seem to lose sight of the overall meaning of the Gua the minute they start reading the Lines, forgetting that the Lines depict specific facets or expressions of the Gua's overarching meaning. A lot of confusion in the lines can be cleared up simply by getting out of this habit. For our purposes here, this can be made to work in reverse: we can take what we understand of the Line Texts and uses this to stretch our understanding of the Gua. Here again we have a converse to use: If our Core Meaning for a Gua does not help to explain a Line, or if a Line text does not seem like a natural expression of the overall Gua theme, then the we still have work to be done in comprehending that theme.

   Finally, there is another fashionable claim in circulation that the Zhouyi was originally intended strictly as a divination manual, but a couple of centuries into its existence it began to be used as a more philosophical text. It is left to the reader to conclude that the Zhouyi somehow changed or at least broadened its intended and original purpose some time after its completion or some time after its authors had died. A lot of readers seem to buy that, since it keeps getting repeated. It is never pointed out the the authors may have had other things in mind beyond simple divination and it just took the readers a few short centuries to figure this out. That's easier to swallow than them changing their original intentions two centuries into the future. Obviously, serving the King and his court with a new and simplified way of divining was the Yi's raison d'être. But that alone fails to explain the broader ethical and psychological applicability of the work. The authors were also trying to teach future Kings.

    4) Xiangshu. The Image and Number school, that contrasts so readily with Yili above, looks to the elements of structure of the diagrams for either a separate layer of meaning from
, or an explanation of how the words of the text originally came about. I have used the terms Dimensions and Algorithms for these structural elements. Those that can be considered most germane to Yixue are scoped in my Book of Changes, Vol. 2, The Dimensions, and can be grouped into three categories: 1) Zhouyi dimensions, or those that the original authors appear to have had access to, 2) Wing dimensions, or those introduced in the Yi's Ten Wings, and 3) Han Yiweishu dimensions, or those which were introduced in the large body of Han apocryphal writings on the Yi. This last field is practically unlimited and is subject to analysis as far reaching as that of binary mathematics itself. But our concern here is with the relevance of the Dimensions to the Core Meanings of the Gua and ultimately to the Gua Ming that have to summarize these. The question is: Which dimensions help to define the Core Meanings of the Gua? Of those that I have surveyed there is only a limited number and nearly all of them belong in the first category of Zhouyi dimensions. Volume II has more detail on most of these.

    One aspect of the Yi's Dimensions is never pointed out, even for those that were used by the original authors: not one of them seems to have been used with any sort of rigid or unflagging consistency. The authors had some structure to begin with and a number of Dimensions as tools to create with, tools that helped them to find useful words and metaphors to shape the larger ideas. They seemed to have used these tools when convenient and not use them when inconvenient. This of course makes it difficult to prove their use, and it takes some punch out of arguments that dimensions invented later were not used, simply because they lack statistical significance. More fuzzy edges. Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.

    Gua Xiang, or the Hexagram Image, sometimes called Gua Xing, or Hexagram Shape, is the purest and most obvious, but as a dimension of the Core Meaning it is only found in some of the Gua. Simply put, this is where the shape of a Gua suggests the main idea: 27 as an open mouth, 50 as a Cauldron, 01 as a Mountain that is too tall and narrow for its own long-term good, 62 as a bird in flight.

    Yao Wei, or Line Position. Gua with a solitary solid or broken line can often be interpreted using traditional associations with the position that the line is found in. Singletons in Line 5, for example, might speak of leadership qualities, or at least add the subject of leadership qualities to the Core Meaning. The utility of this dimension is fairly limited to a few Gua, but it may have planted the seed for the Han Yiweishu dimension of Governing and Constituting Lines. Governing and Constituting Lines, however, seems to be no more than one man's idea of which lines stood out the most to him: they have no mystical powers.

    Ban Xiang, or the Half-Images. The relationship between the two Bagua as they are situated in the Lower and Upper (or Zhen and Hui) positions is one of the more important, even though there is a school (or university) of thought that claims the Bagua were unknown to the Zhouyi authors. This dimension is well-explored in the Da Xiang, a part of the Wings, which derives ethical advice and meaning for each of the Gua based on its constituent Bagua in the two positions. I consider this text to be on a par with the Zhouyi itself when it comes to being meaningful. In looking at the Da Xiang from within the core Meaning, the relationship between the interacting Ba Gua in upper and lower places can be felt viscerally and topologically and the ethical or behavioral advice that follows will appear to be a logical conclusion. Conversely, until this text seems to follow logically from the Bagua configuration, the gestalt is still missing input.

    Qian Gua, or the Inverse Pairs, also known as Fu Gua, Dian Gua, etc. While the full sequence of the Hou Tian, Later Heaven, Wen Wang Xu, or King Wen Sequence is not any more significant or meaningful than any exercise in pareidolia, the thirty-two pairs within this sequence did contribute to the development of Gua meaning, some in very meaningful ways. Twenty-eight of these pairs are the inverse of each other. By name the most obvious pair is 41-42, Decreasing-Increasing. Others are reasonably clear: 37-38, Family Members and Estrangement, for example. The pair 19-20 is actually mentioned in the Zhouyi text by the Lunar months they represent (see below). The pair 63-64 is significant in several of the structural dimensions. And some pairs simply await the student's exercise in comparison to reveal their mysteries: 43-44, Decisiveness or Resolution and Dissipation for example.

    Pang Tong Gua, or the Opposite Pairs, also known as Bian Gua, etc. Four pairs within the received sequence are symmetrical and thus are the inverse of themselves, and so they are paired in the sequence with their Opposites. Here too their Core Meanings help to mutually derive from each other as complementary opposites: 01-02 as Heaven and Earth, 29-30 as Water and Fire are the most obvious examples, but 61-62 as self-importance and unimportance has much to offer for a little digging. We'll leave 27-28 as an exercise.

    Chong Gua, or the Doubled Bagua. The eight Bagua or Trigrams each have Gua where they are doubled and even share their names. However, the meanings of the Gua are more complex, and learning in what way they are more complex makes a very interesting study or exercise. In short, this Gua is usually a learning or growing experience, over time. The characteristic energy of the Bagua becomes self-aware and changes by way of a feedback process.

    Shi Er Di Zhi or the Twelve earthly Branches. Although most of the Calendar associations to the Gua were derived much later, Twelve of the Gua were associated with the 12 Months of the Year from a very early date, and the time of year that each represents makes a significant contribution towards understanding many of these Gua. The relationship of 19-20, mentioned above, is found in the text itself. 24 is explicitly associated with the Winter Solstice.

    Of all of the Wing dimensions, the only one that I find remotely significant for the Gua Ming is that of Correctness, that a Yang line belongs in an odd place, and here only in a couple of Gua, notably 63 & 64. But even this may be begging a question since the origin of Correctness as a dimension may actually have derived from the meanings of 63 & 64. There is certainly no statistical evidence in the text that a line has a better auspice for being in the "correct" place.

    5) Yixue Commentary Tradition. The long Zhouyi commentary tradition begins in theory in 671 BCE with the first Zuozhuan reading and would encompass all pre-Qin divination accounts, all external cultural references, and finally the Shi Yi or Ten Wings that were incorporated with the Zhouyi in 136 BCE as the Yijing Canon. The Yijing commentary tradition begins subsequent to this, but might be thought to include any Han apocrypha that was written just prior to canonization. It is considered an error by many to divide things like this because the Ten Wings are usually thought to be an integral part of the Yi. They are neither integral nor fundamental. In a great many ways the bulk of the Wing observations are misleading and distracting. The Xici Zhuan or Da Zhuan invents a whole metaphysical philosophy that is projected back onto the original text, obscuring its earlier meanings. This includes the ideas of Yin and Yang. The Zhouyi observes many interesting oppositions, reciprocities and complementarities, but Yin and Yang are foreign to it. The Tuan Zhuan and Xiao Xiang frequently stumble in their interpretations, using artificial dimensions that simply do not work to elucidate the meanings. They do hit the mark on enough occasions to make them worthy of serious study, but this study is most useful in conjunction with a set of critical reasoning skills. That said, however, the Tuan Zhuan provides alternative Chinese glosses or terms or for most of the Gua and these, in nearly all cases, have played crucial roles in shaping our understanding of the Gua Ming. In a few instances, most notably Gua 30, they have added insights that completely transformed our understanding.

    The Da Xiang simply reiterates the Gua Ming and so it does not contribute much to the vocabulary. The ethical lessons here are not often succinct enough to serve as key words in shaping our Core Meanings either. But understanding how the Bagua fit together to generate the ethical lessons here adds a great deal of insight to the Core Meaning's gestalt, and this is in all 64 cases.

    The Xu Gua, or recital on the Hexagram Sequence, adds an occasional new gloss for the Gua Ming, or a key word for the Core Meaning, but this is hit and miss, and tends to be more reliable when transiting between the inverse or opposite pairs, not the random sequence between those pairs. It doesn't always fail here though: pareidolia is a very useful talent in the process of discovery. The Za Gua has roughly the same utility as the Xu Gua, providing the occasional useful gloss or key word.

    The Chinese-language body of commentary is immense. There are several thousands of volumes and tracts listed in the Yixue Bibliography below, especially in the Sike Quanshu. But one thing becomes clear in reading the scholars in the Yi's original language: While becoming truly proficient in understanding the Yi will require reading the text in the original (or as much of it as we can reconstruct), this is not a guarantee of understanding. The language is necessary but not sufficient for any real expertise. Over the last few centuries, translations into other world languages have added a great deal of insight into the text and into the Core Meanings of the Gua. This is for two main reasons: a) to the extent that the Yi is describing human universals in social roles and behaviors, we are broadening and enriching our perspective on the images and metaphors, giving us new and perhaps long-lost ways to look at the original text, and b) since there are fewer Chinese words to go around (less than a tenth of the vocabulary of English), they must of necessity be richer in connotation and more complex in alternative and ambiguous meanings, but poorer in specificity: global languages with broader vocabularies can articulate and detail the nuances of meaning better than the original Chinese can. In short, the optimum study of the Yi, even the pure study of its original texts, is multilingual.

    The following has a more general relevance than just to the commentary tradition: Polysemy, the coexistence of many possible meanings for a particular word, is a predominant characteristic of Old Chinese. Western linguists want to exclude homonyms from this and, in this effort, try to narrow the definition of polysemy to a network of meanings with a common source, root meanings and shared history. This does not always work for Chinese, where even the most skillful pareidolia and speculative etymology cannot connect the dots between many of the meanings which share the same character. Elsewhere I have ranted about the academics' willful ignorance of this feature of the language, wherein they will insist that only attested meanings from outside the text of the Zhouyi can be used in translating the Zhouyi, and that using the internal context of the Zhouyi is off limits in understanding the words used therein.

    However, looking at some of the polysemous variations on a Chinese word can have interesting applications in fleshing out core meanings. Take, for instance, Lí, Gua Ming 30, to stand out, diverge, or with special relevance to this Gua, to radiate. The word made from the Latin words for "stand out" is Exist. One of the polysemous variations of Lí is a "bright bird," especially an Oriole. Anyone who has ever looked out onto a stark winter landscape, into a bush with no leaves or color, and seen a bright bird like this perched there, now has a permanent memory of what standing out is all about. It's also what fire does. Lí also has associations to a net, probably for catching either birds or fish. The potential contribution of this to 30's Core Meaning might be a bit more obscure, but you can argue a case for the interconnectedness or interdependence of the net's structure. Maybe more relevant is that the Zhou Chinese had an association of webs or nets (wǎng, see Gua 34.3) with wits, subtlety, cleverness, or a knack for deception. This is perfectly consistent with the word Míng, one of Gua 30's Chinese Key Words, as brightness or intelligence.



Appendix:
The Gua Ming as a Dimension of the Zhouyi

The following is excerpted from The Book of Changes: Word By Word, Volume 2, pp. 8-11. This is another take from another time, with some repetition and some additional analogies.

    It may require a number of analogies to appreciate the differences between defining a simple term and charting the full range of meanings and connotations of a Hexagram’s Name. Ming, the Chinese word for Name, also means reputation. Old Chinese is already much more of a connotative than a denotative or definitive language. Its smaller vocabulary is only due to its words embodying a greater range of connections, perceptions and applications. The set of Gua Names is like this but much more so (so some of the principles given here may also be helpful in better understanding other examples of the Yijing’s important words and concepts). Each name is meant to cover one part in sixty-four of the human experience. The (fictitious) image was offered earlier of a large set of jars to contain the Zhouyi authors’ working notes. Needham, Crowley and others have already suggested the filing system metaphor. The notion that these names are operationally defined abstracts, which was brought up earlier in revisiting the discredited Lacouperie/Conrady lexical theory, is not a new idea here either. Helmut Wilhem calls the purpose of this “to establish collectively valid images.” (Heaven, Earth & Man, p. 201) and writes:

    It is an interesting phenomenon that many of these conceptual names of hexagrams are so-called hapax legomena; they do not occur in the earlier literature at places other than these names, and a number of them have never been used in the later literature except in passages directly derivative from these hexagrams. What we observe here is apparently an attempt to create and formulate concepts for specific purposes, if not to define them. We stand witness here to the first manifestation of a new stage in the self-realization of the human mind in which the faculty of judgment is first exercised and leads to abstractions distinct from images ... . It would be a fallacy ... to reduce these concepts to their image antecedents and to deny the authors of these early texts the faculty of abstraction that is reflected in these terms ... . p. 200

        Once conceived, the term then took on a life of its own, feeding on and being fed by those regions of the human mind that are given to abstractions ... . In the course of this development, the origin of the term has become more and more meaningless and eventually entirely forgotten. [p. 204] [I have underlined origin for the benefit of the modern context critics and etymologists who seem so reluctant to observe this process and insist upon using “Piglet” as a translation for Dun and “Elephant Dance” for Yu, though these make no sense at all].

    Another analogy might view these Gua Ming terms as ‘gravitational centers’ within the imagination, attracting meanings to themselves in proportion both to their own mass and a potential new meaning’s proximity, and forming a system out of chaotic clouds much as our own solar system formed. Particles too distant, or with too much mass or inertia of their own, would escape this attraction. These particles array or cluster themselves into an open set of Key Words, wherein ‘A’ is seldom equal to ‘B.’ These are correspondence sets, not equivalence sets. The weak spot in this analogy is that there is frequently no single, perfect word or association which occupies the exact center, or the whole periphery, of the meaning. Often the most useful name is one which bridges the broadest gaps between the meanings.

    Or: think of staking out a new territory. No single stake will cover the range (unless that range be too small to graze or farm). And the more stakes one sets, the fewer are the subsequent boundary disputes. The neighbors’ versions of the boundaries are given equal weight when one goes to the higher order. Such ‘definition’ of a wide range of meanings by connotative Key Words is common to all languages with a closed or finite number of vocabulary elements. Here the analogy’s weak spots are that stakes are as often placed at landmarks within the terrain and that these terms are often not defined entirely by circumscription or definition: they also take on meanings according to their abilities to combine and interrelate, or to be permuted or extrapolated from. And they are often defined by references points far outside of their own domain, by their position in an overall pattern. The boundaries here define starting points, or places to return to. Their intent is not the compression of meaning but rather its expansion into the remaining dimensions: to open the mind, not to fill it up. The words are meant to be stimuli, not merely responses. They describe, they do not determine. They are names for perspectives, but what is viewed from these perspectives remains a moving pageant and hopefully a surprise.

    Wang Bi (226-249) of the Yi Li school (long before it was named Yi Li) was concerned with the process of getting to the core meanings of the names through the ever-growing clusters of words, a process known as Zheng Ming or Rectification of Names. Shaughnessy (1983) translates Wang’s Zhouyi lueli on the subject of Sao Xiang (Sweeping Out the Images) at some length and this warrants inclusion here:

    Images are that which express ideas and language is that which illuminates images. There is nothing like images for understanding ideas and nothing like language for understanding images. Because language is born of images, it is possible to follow language in order to see the images. And because images are born of ideas, it is possible to follow images in order to see the ideas. Ideas are understood through images, images made clear through language.

    Therefore, since language is what is used to explicate images, when you have gotten the image, forget the language; since images are what is used to fix ideas, when you have gotten the idea, forget the image. ... If the meaning is ‘strength,’ what need is there for ‘horse?’ If the category is ‘obedience,’ what need is there for ‘cow?’ If the line corresponds to ‘obedience,’ what need is there for Kun to be ‘cow;’ and if the line corresponds with ‘strength,’ what need is there for Qian then to be ‘horse?’

    And yet, there are those who establish Qian as ‘horse.’ If correlating the text with the hexagram, there is ‘horse’ but no Qian, then artificial theories propagate and it is difficult to draw lines. If the ‘internal form’ is insufficient, they follow it with the ‘hexagram change.’ And if the changed text is insufficient, they push it further with the ‘five phases.’ Once the source has been lost, the cleverness becomes ever more intricate. If such cleverness is allowed to go unchecked, there is no place to get the meaning, and this is all because of concentrating on the image while forgetting the idea. Forget the images and seek the ideas; the meaning will then be apparent. [p. 5.]

    This approach has its strengths in terms of finding the center of the territory, or the gravitational center of a cluster of meanings. But it has two problems as well: 1) If one is premature in dismissing the words and the images one runs the risk of being stuck with a wrong or peripheral idea as a core meaning. Wang Bi himself can often be found in this predicament. And, 2) To confine oneself to the center misses the whole point of being in the center. Focus, in the Yijing, is not the same thing as narrow mindedness or tunnel vision. Concentration shares an etymological root with concentric: a plurality which shares a center, much as nested sets do. The center (zhong) has its greatest value in its being the locus which is nearest to all of the options. This makes right and left more handy, not things to be avoided. To be stuck in the center is to forgo a richness and diversity: thereby does one’s path become a rut. Or imagine a gem with only one facet. Only a mobius strip does this and these useless things go nowhere. On a gem the facets face apart, and no two face the same direction. Yet most face also inward towards a core.

    The Yijing is meant to teach wisdom, and there is much more to the getting of wisdom than the getting of the lingo, but this is where to start in a book. And so it is a good thing to look for the center in the midst of a cluster of words. Two other images may help, and both of these are related to probability laws: In certain athletic competitions where individual performances are rated by a number of judges, the high and low scores are often eliminated before an average of the remaining scores is taken. Prejudice, or premature judgment, is one of the reasons for this. In collecting the Key Words for this edition and editing them to a manageable number, it served a purpose to eliminate a great number of peripheral ideas, especially those where aspects or other meanings are shared by other terms. Deferred gratification, for instance, is a theme common to many a Gua. But this does not mean that peripheral ideas do not belong within the territory. The Key Word study is meant to help one to get the mind around the entire center. But expansion from here is still necessary. Second image: In the learning of archery, in the truing of one’s aim, one might first shoot a whole quiver full of arrows and only then assess the pattern. Not all shots are equidistant. Usually it will be the approximate center of the pattern which locates the center of one’s aim. This will probably not be the arrow found in the neighbor’s yard or cow (the rooster was something different). The next step is to fine tune the stance, and the follow through, and the point of focus, moving this point of aim eventually towards the center of the target. This process is also zhong, depicting a bullseye and meaning both true and center.

    As described earlier in the hypothetical history, the known range of a term’s meanings (semantic field) both grows and shrinks over time, and it does so according to both deductive and inductive logic, both theoretical and empirical input. This process is much like life - now divergent and diastolic, now convergent and systolic. The word meanings are grown first and then pruned back, added to whenever one gets a bright idea or deleted from whenever an idea fails to pass its tests against big Substance. “Turning and returning is the Dao.” In the broader context of Yixue, the Yijing’s vocabulary elements are far less fixed than its various structural elements. To the extent that the Yi is a language, its thesaurus is a loose-leafed notebook rather than a scripture. Yixue is an evolving tradition.

    The range of the Xiao Gua (Small Symbol) meanings is fairly well scoped in the Glossary and in Xiao Gua. Perhaps the best place to begin to learn the Gua Ming is in the Glossary. All of the Gua Names, or at least all of their components, may be found here. The Key Words section in the Translation is a little more adventurous, liberal and anachronistic. In Xiao Gua, under the Ba Gua, Glosses From the Text, the Zhouyi and Wing texts have been combed for Chinese glosses and synonyms to the Trigram meanings. The bulk of these came from the Chong (Repeated Trigram) Gua, discussed later. But in all of the more complex Gua the same thing can be done as an exercise: the text of every Gua (with its Wing commentaries) offers at least a few of these glosses and synonyms. This exercise will prove especially valuable in cases where the Gua Ming is used only once, in the Gua Ci, or is not repeated in the Yao Ci in a variety of contexts (this happens at Gua 02, 09, 11, 14, 26, 61, 63 & 64). Normally the Gua Ming is introduced as a word (or a word combination) which stands alone out of context. It is only at Gua 10, 12, 13 & 52 where a Name makes its entry embedded in textual syntax. In Old Chinese, having syntax and a context to work with is almost as useful as having a dictionary.

    Dichotomy, in a couple of its many forms, was used by the Zhouyi authors to help define a Gua Ming against, or in contrast with, that of a structurally resonant partner. The structures used here were most often the dimensions of Inverse Hexagrams (Qian Gua) and Opposite Hexagrams (Pang Tong Gua) elaborated upon later. Some of these are obvious. Among the many Inverse pairs, look at: 41, Sun, Decreasing and 42, Yi, Increasing; or 51, Zhen, as motion and 52, Gen, as rest; or 57, Xun, as mental and 58, Dui, as emotional. Among the Opposite pairs, look at 01, Qian, Creating and 02, Kun, Accepting (this is the courage to change what I can, along with the serenity to accept the rest); or 11, Tai, as interactive and 12, Pi as alienated; or 29, Kan, as water and 30, Li, as fire; or 51, Zhen, as force and 57, Xun, as finesse; or 52, Gen, as satiety and 58, Dui as need. Note here that, in the above examples, 51, Zhen; 52, Gen; 57, Xun and 58, Dui were all paired and contrasted along two different dimensional axes.

    The polarities that are exhibited on the face of the hexagram names themselves are by no means the end of this. The mere presence of a dimension can often assist the understanding. Take, for example, the Opposite pair of 61, Zhong Fu, The Truth Within and 62, Xiao Guo, Smallness in Excess. The first concerns how big and important we feel when we are contained inside of ourselves, the second concerns how small and insignificant we feel when we are alone in the outer world. This calls to mind a dichotomy in a Leonard Cohen song: “We are so small between the stars, so large against the sky ... .” The juxtaposition and contraposition of ideas is important throughout the Yijing, but this has a higher order and purpose too: in the internal resolution of paradox as a path to wisdom.
